<p style='text-align:center;font-size:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_ix'></a>ix</span>INTRODUCTION</p>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> Diary of Caroline Cowles Richards fell into
my hands, so to speak, out of space. I had no
previous acquaintance with the author, and I sat
down to read the book one evening in no especial
mood of anticipation. From the first page to the
last my attention was riveted. To call it fascinating
barely expresses the quality of the charm. Caroline
Richards and her sister Anna, having early lost
their mother, were sent to the home of her parents
in Canandaigua, New York, where they were
brought up in the simplicity and sweetness of a refined
household, amid Puritan traditions. The children
were allowed to grow as plants do, absorbing
vitality from the atmosphere around them. Whatever
there was of gracious formality in the manners
of aristocratic people of the period, came to
them as their birthright, while the spirit of the
truest democracy pervaded their home. Of this
Diary it is not too much to say that it is a revelation
of childhood in ideal conditions.</p>

<p>The Diary begins in 1852, and is continued until
1872. Those of us who lived in the latter half of
the nineteenth century recall the swift transitions,
the rapid march of science and various changes in
social customs, and as we meet allusions to these
in the leaves of the girl&#8217;s Diary we live our past
over again with peculiar pleasure.</p>

<p>Far more has been told us concerning the South
during the Civil War than concerning the North.
Fiction has found the North a less romantic field,
and the South has been chosen as the background of
many a stirring novel, while only here and there
has an author been found who has known the deep-hearted
loyalty of the Northern States and woven
the story into narrative form. The girl who grew
up in Canandaigua was intensely patriotic, and from
day to day vividly chronicled what she saw, felt,
and heard. Her Diary is a faithful record of impressions
of that stormy time in which the nation
underwent a baptism of fire. The realism of her
paragraphs is unsurpassed.</p>

<p>Beyond the personal claim of the Diary and the
certainty to give pleasure to a host of readers, the
author appeals to Americans in general because of
her family and her friends. Her father and grandfather
were Presbyterian ministers. Her Grandfather
Richards was for twenty years President of
Auburn Theological Seminary. Her brother, John
Morgan Richards of London, has recently given to
the world the Life and Letters of his gifted and
lamented daughter, Pearl Mary-Terèse Craigie,
known best as John Oliver Hobbes. The famous
Field brothers and their father, Rev. David Dudley
Field, and their nephew, Justice David J. Brewer,
of the United States Supreme Court, were her kinsmen.
Miss Hannah Upham, a distinguished
teacher mentioned in the Diary, belongs to the
group of American women to whom we owe the
initiative of what we now choose to call the higher
education of the sex. She, in common with Mary
Lyon, Emma Willard, and Eliza Bayliss Wheaton,
gave a forward impulse to the liberal education of
women, and our privilege is to keep their memory
green. They are to be remembered by what they
have done and by the tender reminiscences found
here and there like pressed flowers in a herbarium,
in such pages as these.</p>

<p>Miss Richards&#8217; marriage to Mr. Edmund C.
Clarke occurred in 1866. Mr. Clarke is a veteran
of the Civil War and a Commander in the Grand
Army of the Republic. His brother, Noah T.
Clarke, was the Principal of Canandaigua Academy
for the long term of forty years. The dignified,
amusing and remarkable personages who were Mrs.
Clarke&#8217;s contemporaries, teachers, or friends are
pictured in her Diary just as they were, so that we
meet them on the street, in the drawing-room, in
church, at prayer-meeting, anywhere and everywhere,
and grasp their hands as if we, too, were
in their presence.</p>

<p>Wherever this little book shall go it will carry
good cheer. Fun and humor sparkle through the
story of this childhood and girlhood so that the
reader will be cheated of ennui, and the sallies of
the little sister will provoke mirth and laughter to
brighten dull days. I have read thousands of books.
I have never read one which has given me more
delight than this.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 21, 1852.&mdash;I am ten years old to-day,
and I think I will write a journal and tell who I
am and what I am doing. I have lived with my
Grandfather and Grandmother Beals ever since I
was seven years old, and Anna, too, since she was
four. Our brothers, James and John, came too,
but they are at East Bloomfield at Mr. Stephen
Clark&#8217;s Academy. Miss Laura Clark of Naples is
their teacher.</p>

<p>Anna and I go to school at District No. 11. Mr.
James C. Cross is our teacher, and some of the
scholars say he is cross by name and cross by nature,
but I like him. He gave me a book by the name
of &#8220;Noble Deeds of American Women,&#8221; for reward
of merit, in my reading class. To-day, a nice old
gentleman, by the name of Mr. William Wood,
visited our school. He is Mrs. Nat Gorham&#8217;s uncle,
and Wood Street is named for him. He had a
beautiful pear in his hand and said he would give
it to the boy or girl who could spell &#8220;virgaloo,&#8221;
for that was the name of the pear. I spelt it that
way, but it was not right. A little boy, named
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>William Schley, spelt it right and he got the pear.
I wish I had, but I can&#8217;t even remember now how
he spelt it. If the pear was as hard as the name I
don&#8217;t believe any one would want it, but I don&#8217;t see
how they happened to give such a hard name to
such a nice pear. Grandfather says perhaps Mr.
Wood will bring in a Seckle pear some day, so I
had better be ready for him.</p>

<p>Grandmother told us such a nice story to-day I
am going to write it down in my journal. I think
I shall write a book some day. Miss Caroline
Chesebro did, and I don&#8217;t see why I can&#8217;t. If I do,
I shall put this story in it. It is a true story and
better than any I found in three story books
Grandmother gave us to read this week, &#8220;Peep of
Day,&#8221; &#8220;Line Upon Line,&#8221; and &#8220;Precept Upon Precept,&#8221;
but this story was better than them all. One
night Grandfather was locking the front door at
nine o&#8217;clock and he heard a queer sound, like a baby
crying. So he unlocked the door and found a
bandbox on the stoop, and the cry seemed to come
from inside of it. So he took it up and brought it
into the dining-room and called the two girls, who
had just gone upstairs to bed. They came right
down and opened the box, and there was a poor
little girl baby, crying as hard as could be. They
took it out and rocked it and sung to it and got
some milk and fed it and then sat up all night
with it, by the fire. There was a paper pinned on
the baby&#8217;s dress with her name on it, &#8220;Lily T.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>LaMott,&#8221; and a piece of poetry called &#8220;Pity the
Poor Orphan.&#8221; The next morning, Grandfather
went to the overseer of the poor and he said it
should be taken to the county house, so our hired
man got the horse and buggy, and one of the girls
carried the baby and they took it away. There was
a piece in the paper about it, and Grandmother
pasted it into her &#8220;Jay&#8217;s Morning and Evening
Exercises,&#8221; and showed it to us. It said, &#8220;A Deposit
After Banking Hours.&#8221; &#8220;Two suspicious
looking females were seen about town in the afternoon,
one of them carrying an infant. They took
a train early in the morning without the child.
They probably secreted themselves in Mr. Beals&#8217;
yard and if he had not taken the box in they would
have carried it somewhere else.&#8221; When Grandfather
told the clerks in the bank about it next
morning, Mr. Bunnell, who lives over by Mr. Daggett&#8217;s,
on the park, said, if it had been left at some
people&#8217;s houses it would not have been sent away.
Grandmother says they heard that the baby was
adopted afterwards by some nice people in Geneva.
People must think this is a nice place for children,
for they had eleven of their own before we came.
Mrs. McCoe was here to call this afternoon and she
looked at us and said: &#8220;It must be a great responsibility,
Mrs. Beals.&#8221; Grandmother said she
thought &#8220;her strength would be equal to her day.&#8221;
That is one of her favorite verses. She said Mrs.
McCoe never had any children of her own and perhaps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>that is the reason she looks so sad at us. Perhaps
some one will leave a bandbox and a baby at
her door some dark night.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Our brother John drove over from
East Bloomfield to-day to see us and brought Julia
Smedley with him, who is just my age. John lives
at Mr. Ferdinand Beebe&#8217;s and goes to school and
Julia is Mr. Beebe&#8217;s niece. They make quantities
of maple sugar out there and they brought us a
dozen little cakes. They were splendid. I offered
John one and he said he would rather throw it over
the fence than to eat it. I can&#8217;t understand that.
Anna had the faceache to-day and I told her that
I would be the doctor and make her a ginger poultice.
I thought I did it exactly right but when I
put it on her face she shivered and said: &#8220;Carrie,
you make lovely poultices only they are so cold.&#8221;
I suppose I ought to have warmed it.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Grandfather took us to ride this afternoon
and let us ask Bessie Seymour to go with us.
We rode on the plank road to Chapinville and had
to pay 2 cents at the toll gate, both ways. We met
a good many people and Grandfather bowed to them
and said, &#8220;How do you do, neighbor?&#8221;</p>

<p>We asked him what their names were and he said
he did not know. We went to see Mr. Munson,
who runs the mill at Chapinville. He took us
through the mill and let us get weighed and took
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>us over to his house and out into the barn-yard to
see the pigs and chickens and we also saw a colt
which was one day old. Anna just wrote in her
journal that &#8220;it was a very amusing site.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;Rev. Mr. Kendall, of East Bloomfield,
preached to-day. His text was from Job 26, 14:
&#8220;Lo these are parts of his ways, but how little a
portion is heard of him.&#8221; I could not make out
what he meant. He is James&#8217; and John&#8217;s minister.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Captain Menteith was at our house
to dinner to-day and he tried to make Anna and me
laugh by snapping his snuff-box under the table.
He is a very jolly man, I think.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Father and Uncle Edward Richards
came to see us yesterday and took us down to Mr.
Corson&#8217;s store and told us we could have anything
we wanted. So we asked for several kinds of
candy, stick candy and lemon drops and bulls&#8217; eyes,
and then they got us two rubber balls and two jumping
ropes with handles and two hoops and sticks to
roll them with and two red carnelian rings and two
bracelets. We enjoyed getting them very much,
and expect to have lots of fun. They went out to
East Bloomfield to see James and John, and father
is going to take them to New Orleans. We hate
to have them go.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;We asked Grandmother if we could
have some hoop skirts like the seminary girls and
she said no, we were not old enough. When we
were downtown Anna bought a reed for 10 cents
and ran it into the hem of her underskirt and says
she is going to wear it to school to-morrow. I
think Grandmother will laugh out loud for once,
when she sees it, but I don&#8217;t think Anna will wear
it to school or anywhere else. She wouldn&#8217;t want
to if she knew how terrible it looked.</p>

<p>I threaded a dozen needles on a spool of thread
for Grandmother, before I went to school, so that
she could slip them along and use them as she needed
them. She says it is a great help.</p>

<p>Grandmother says I will have a great deal to
answer for, because Anna looks up to me so and
tries to do everything that I do and thinks whatever
I say is &#8220;gospel truth.&#8221; The other day the girls
at school were disputing with her about something
and she said, &#8220;It is so, if it ain&#8217;t so, for Calline
said so.&#8221; I shall have to &#8220;toe the mark,&#8221; as Grandfather
says, if she keeps watch of me all the time
and walks in my footsteps.</p>

<p>We asked Grandmother this evening if we could
sit out in the kitchen with Bridget and Hannah and
the hired man, Thomas Holleran. She said we
could take turns and each stay ten minutes by the
clock. It gave us a little change. I read once that
&#8220;variety is the spice of life.&#8221; They sit around the
table and each one has a candle, and Thomas reads
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>aloud to the girls while they sew. He and Bridget
are Catholics, but Hannah is a member of our
Church. The girls have lived here always, I think,
but I don&#8217;t know for sure, as I have not lived here
always myself, but we have to get a new hired man
sometimes. Grandmother says if you are as good
to your girls as you are to yourself they will stay a
long time. I am sure that is Grandmother&#8217;s rule.
Mrs. McCarty, who lives on Brook Street (some
people call it Cat Alley but Grandmother says that is
not proper), washes for us Mondays, and Grandmother
always has a lunch for her at eleven o&#8217;clock
and goes out herself to see that she sits down and
eats it. Mrs. McCarty told us Monday that Mrs.
Brockle&#8217;s niece was dead, who lives next door to her.
Grandmother sent us over with some things for their
comfort and told us to say that we were sorry they
were in trouble. We went and when we came back
Anna told Grandmother that I said, &#8220;Never mind,
Mrs. Brockle, some day we will all be dead.&#8221; I am
sure that I said something better than that.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;Mr. Cross had us speak pieces to-day.
He calls our names, and we walk on to the
platform and toe the mark and make a bow and
say what we have got to say. He did not know
what our pieces were going to be and some of them
said the same ones. Two boys spoke: &#8220;The boy
stood on the burning deck, whence all but him had
fled.&#8221; William Schley was one, and he spoke his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>the best. When he said, &#8220;The flames that lit the
battle wreck shone round him o&#8217;er the dead,&#8221; we
could almost see the fire, and when he said, &#8220;My
father, must I stay?&#8221; we felt like telling him, no,
he needn&#8217;t. He is going to make a good speaker.
Mr. Cross said so. Albert Murray spoke &#8220;Excelsior,&#8221;
and Horace Finley spoke nice, too. My
piece was, &#8220;Why, Phoebe, are you come so soon?
Where are your berries, child?&#8221; Emma Van Arsdale
spoke the same one. We find them all in our
reader. Sometime I am going to speak, &#8220;How does
the water come down at Ladore?&#8221; Splashing and
flashing and dashing and clashing and all that&mdash;it
rhymes, so it is easy to remember.</p>

<p>We played snap the whip at recess to-day
and I was on the end and was snapped off against
the fence. It hurt me so, that Anna cried. It is
not a very good game for girls, especially for the
one on the end.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;I could not keep a journal for two
weeks, because Grandfather and Grandmother have
been very sick and we were afraid something dreadful
was going to happen. We are so glad that they
are well again. Grandmother was sick upstairs and
Grandfather in the bedroom downstairs, and we
carried messages back and forth for them. Dr.
Carr and Aunt Mary came over twice every day
and said they had the influenza and the inflammation
of the lungs. It was lonesome for us to sit
down to the table and just have Hannah wait on us.
We did not have any blessing because there was no
one to ask it. Anna said she could, but I was afraid
she would not say it right, so I told her she needn&#8217;t.
We had such lumps in our throats we could not eat
much and we cried ourselves to sleep two or three
nights. Aunt Ann Field took us home with her one
afternoon to stay all night. We liked the idea and
Mary and Louisa and Anna and I planned what we
would play in the evening, but just as it was dark our
hired man, Patrick McCarty, drove over after us.
He said Grandfather and Grandmother could not get
to sleep till they saw the children and bid them good-night.
So we rode home with him. We never
stayed anywhere away from home all night that we
can remember. When Grandmother came downstairs
the first time she was too weak to walk, so
she sat on each step till she got down. When
Grandfather saw her, he smiled and said to us:
&#8220;When she will, she will, you may depend on&#8217;t;
and when she won&#8217;t she won&#8217;t, and that&#8217;s the
end on&#8217;t.&#8221; But we knew all the time that he was
very glad to see her.</p>

</div>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday, March 20.</i>&mdash;It snowed so, that we could
not go to church to-day and it was the longest day
I ever spent. The only excitement was seeing the
snowplow drawn by two horses, go up on this
side of the street and down on the other. Grandfather
put on his long cloak with a cape, which he
wears in real cold weather, and went. We wanted
to pull some long stockings over our shoes and go
too but Grandmother did not think it was best.
She gave us the &#8220;Dairyman&#8217;s Daughter&#8221; and
&#8220;Jane the Young Cottager,&#8221; by Leigh Richmond, to
read. I don&#8217;t see how they happened to be so awfully
good. Anna says they died of &#8220;early piety,&#8221;
but she did not say it very loud. Grandmother said
she would give me 10 cents if I would learn the
verses in the New England Primer that John Rogers
left for his wife and nine small children and one
at the breast, when he was burned at the stake, at
Smithfield, England, in 1555. One verse is, &#8220;I
leave you here a little book for you to look upon that
you may see your father&#8217;s face when he is dead and
gone.&#8221; It is a very long piece but I got it. Grandmother
says &#8220;the blood of the martyrs is the seed
of the church.&#8221; Anna learned</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<table summary='poetry' class='left2'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;In Adam&#8217;s fall we sinned all.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>My Book and heart shall never part.</p>
<p>The Cat doth play and after slay.</p>
<p>The Dog doth bite a thief at night.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
</div>

<p>When she came to the end of it and said,</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<table summary='poetry' class='left2'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;Zaccheus he, did climb a tree, his Lord to see.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
</div>

<p>she said she heard some one say, &#8220;The tree broke
down and let him fall and he did not see his Lord
at all.&#8221; Grandmother said it was very wicked indeed
and she hoped Anna would try and forget it.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>April 1.</i>&mdash;Grandmother sent me up into the little
chamber to-day to straighten things and get the
room ready to be cleaned. I found a little book
called &#8220;Child&#8217;s Pilgrim Progress, Illustrated,&#8221; that
I had never seen before. I got as far as Giant
Despair when Anna came up and said Grandmother
sent her to see what I was doing, and she went
back and told her that I was sitting on the floor in
the midst of books and papers and was so absorbed
in &#8220;Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress&#8221; that I had made none myself.
It must be a good book for Grandmother did
not say a word. Father sent us &#8220;Gulliver&#8217;s Travels&#8221;
and there is a gilt picture on the green cover,
of a giant with legs astride and little Lilliputians
standing underneath, who do not come up to his
knees. Grandmother did not like the picture, so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>she pasted a piece of pink calico over it, so we could
only see the giant from his waist up. I love the
story of Cinderella and the poem, &#8220;&#8217;Twas the night
before Christmas,&#8221; and I am sorry that there are
no fairies and no Santa Claus.</p>

<p>We go to school to Miss Zilpha Clark in her own
house on Gibson Street. Other girls who go are
Laura Chapin, Julia Phelps, Mary Paul, Bessie Seymour,
Lucilla and Mary Field, Louisa Benjamin,
Nannie Corson, Kittie Marshall, Abbie Clark and
several other girls. I like Abbie Clark the best of
all the girls in school excepting of course my sister
Anna.</p>

<p>Before I go to school every morning I read three
chapters in the Bible. I read three every day and
five on Sunday and that takes me through the Bible
in a year. Those I read this morning were the first,
second and third chapters of Job. The first was
about Eliphaz reproveth Job; second, Benefit of
God&#8217;s correction; third, Job justifieth his complaint.
I then learned a text to say at school. I went to
school at quarter to nine and recited my text and
we had prayers and then proceeded with the business
of the day. Just before school was out, we recited
in &#8220;Science of Things Familiar,&#8221; and in Dictionary,
and then we had calisthenics.</p>

<p>We go through a great many figures and sing &#8220;A
Life on the Ocean Wave,&#8221; &#8220;What Fairy-like Music
Steals Over the Sea,&#8221; &#8220;Lightly Row, Lightly Row,
O&#8217;er the Glassy Waves We Go,&#8221; and &#8220;O Come,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>Come Away,&#8221; and other songs. Mrs. Judge Taylor
wrote one song on purpose for us.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>May 1.</i>&mdash;I arose this morning about the usual
time and read my three chapters in the Bible and
had time for a walk in the garden before breakfast.
The polyanthuses are just beginning to blossom and
they border all the walk up and down the garden.
I went to school at quarter of nine, but did not get
along very well because we played too much. We
had two new scholars to-day, Miss Archibald and
Miss Andrews, the former about seventeen and the
latter about fifteen. In the afternoon old Mrs. Kinney
made us a visit, but she did not stay very long.
In dictionary class I got up sixth, although I had
not studied my lesson very much.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>July.</i>&mdash;Hiram Goodrich, who lives at Mr. Myron
H. Clark&#8217;s, and George and Wirt Wheeler ran away
on Sunday to seek their fortunes. When they did
not come back every one was frightened and started
out to find them. They set out right after Sunday
School, taking their pennies which had been given
them for the contribution, and were gone several
days. They were finally found at Palmyra. When
asked why they had run away, one replied that he
thought it was about time they saw something of
the world. We heard that Mr. Clark had a few
moments&#8217; private conversation with Hiram in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>barn and Mr. Wheeler the same with his boys and
we do not think they will go traveling on their own
hook again right off. Miss Upham lives right
across the street from them and she was telling little
Morris Bates that he must fight the good fight of
faith and he asked her if that was the fight that
Wirt Wheeler fit. She probably had to make her
instructions plainer after that.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>July.</i>&mdash;Every Saturday our cousins, Lucilla and
Mary and Louisa Field, take turns coming to Grandmother&#8217;s
to dinner. It was Mary&#8217;s turn to-day, but
she was sick and couldn&#8217;t come, so Grandmother
told us that we could dress up and make some calls
for her. We were very glad. She told us to go
to Mrs. Gooding&#8217;s first, so we did and she was glad
to see us and gave us some cake she had just made.
Then we went on to Mr. Greig&#8217;s. We walked up
the high steps to the front door and rang the bell
and Mr. Alexander came. We asked if Mrs. Greig
and Miss Chapin were at home and he said yes, and
asked us into the parlor. We looked at the paintings
on the wall and looked at ourselves in the long
looking-glass, while we were waiting. Mrs. Irving
came in first. She was very nice and said I looked
like her niece, Julie Jeffrey. I hope I do, for I
would like to look like her. Mrs. Greig and Miss
Chapin came in and were very glad to see us, and
took us out into the greenhouse and showed us all
the beautiful plants. When we said we would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>to go they said goodbye and sent love to Grandmother
and told us to call again. I never knew
Anna to act as polite as she did to-day. Then we
went to see Mrs. Judge Phelps and Miss Eliza
Chapin, and they were very nice and gave us some
flowers from their garden. Then we went on to
Miss Caroline Jackson&#8217;s, to see Mrs. Holmes.
Sometimes she is my Sunday School teacher, and
she says she and our mother used to be great friends
at the seminary. She said she was glad we came
up and she hoped we would be as good as our mother
was. That is what nearly every one says. On our
way back, we called on Mrs. Dana at the Academy,
as she is a friend of Grandmother. She is Mrs.
Noah T. Clarke&#8217;s mother. After that, we went
home and told Grandmother we had a very pleasant
time calling on our friends and they all asked us to
come again.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday, August 15.</i>&mdash;To-day the Sacrament of
the Lord&#8217;s Supper was held in our church, and Mr.
Daggett baptized several little babies. They looked
so cunning when he took them in his arms and not
one of them cried. I told Grandmother when we
got home that I remembered when Grandfather
Richards baptized me in Auburn, and when he gave
me back to mother he said, &#8220;Blessed little lambkin,
you&#8217;ll never know your grandpa.&#8221; She said I was
mistaken about remembering it, for he died before
I was a year old, but I had heard it told so many
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>times I thought I remembered it. Probably that
is the way it was but I know it happened.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>November 22.</i>&mdash;I wrote a composition to-day,
and the subject was, &#8220;Which of the Seasons Is the
Pleasantest?&#8221; Anna asked Grandmother what she
should write about, and Grandmother said she
thought &#8220;A Contented Mind&#8221; would be a very good
subject, but Anna said she never had one and didn&#8217;t
know what it meant, so she didn&#8217;t try to write any
at all.</p>

<p>A squaw walked right into our kitchen to-day with
a blanket over her head and had beaded purses to
sell.</p>

<p>This is my composition which I wrote: &#8220;Which
of the seasons is the pleasantest? Grim winter with
its cold snows and whistling winds, or pleasant
spring with its green grass and budding trees, or
warm summer with its ripening fruit and beautiful
flowers, or delightful autumn with its golden fruit
and splendid sunsets? I think that I like all the
seasons very well. In winter comes the blazing fire
and Christmas treat. Then we can have sleigh-rides
and play in the snow and generally get pretty
cold noses and toses. In spring we have a great
deal of rain and very often snow and therefore we
do not enjoy that season as much as we would if it
was dry weather, but we should remember that
April showers bring May flowers. In summer we
can hear the birds warbling their sweet notes in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>trees and we have a great many strawberries, currants,
gooseberries and cherries, which I like very
much, indeed, and I think summer is a very pleasant
season. In autumn we have some of our choicest
fruits, such as peaches, pears, apples, grapes and
plums and plenty of flowers in the former part, but
in the latter, about in November, the wind begins
to blow and the leaves to fall and the flowers to
wither and die. Then cold winter with its sleigh-rides
comes round again.&#8221; After I had written
this I went to bed. Anna tied her shoe strings in
hard knots so she could sit up later.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>November 23.</i>&mdash;We read our compositions to-day
and Miss Clark said mine was very good. One of
the girls had a Prophecy for a composition and told
what we were all going to be when we grew up.
She said Anna Richards was going to be a missionary
and Anna cried right out loud. I tried to comfort
her and told her it might never happen, so she
stopped crying.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>November 24.</i>&mdash;Three ladies visited our school
to-day, Miss Phelps, Miss Daniels and Mrs. Clark.
We had calisthenics and they liked them.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;Mr. Tousley preached to-day. Mr.
Lamb is Superintendent of the Sunday School.
Mr. Chipman used to be. Miss Mollie Bull played
the melodeon. Mr. Fairchild is my teacher when he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>is there. He was not there to-day and Miss Mary
Howell taught our class. I wish I could be as good
and pretty as she is. We go to church morning
and afternoon and to Sunday School, and learn
seven verses every week and recite catechism and
hymns to Grandmother in the evening. Grandmother
knows all the questions by heart, so she lets
the book lie in her lap and she asks them with her
eyes shut. She likes to hear us sing:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<table summary='poetry' class='left2'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis religion that can give</p>
<p>Sweetest pleasure while we live,</p>
<p>&#8217;Tis religion can supply</p>
<p>Solid comfort when we die.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>December 1.</i>&mdash;Grandfather asked me to read
President Pierce&#8217;s message aloud to him this evening.
I thought it was very long and dry, but he
said it was interesting and that I read it very well.
I am glad he liked it. Part of it was about the
Missouri Compromise and I didn&#8217;t even know what
it meant.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>December 8.</i>&mdash;We are taking dictation lessons at
school now. Miss Clark reads to us from the &#8220;Life
of Queen Elizabeth&#8221; and we write it down in a
book and keep it. She corrects it for us. I always
spell &#8220;until&#8221; with two l&#8217;s and she has to mark it
every time. I hope I will learn how to spell it
after a while.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span><i>Saturday, December 9.</i>&mdash;We took our music lessons
to-day. Miss Hattie Heard is our teacher and
she says we are getting along well. Anna practiced
her lesson over sixty-five times this morning
before breakfast and can play &#8220;Mary to the
Saviour&#8217;s Tomb&#8221; as fast as a waltz.</p>

<p>We chose sides and spelled down at school to-day.
Julia Phelps and I stood up the last and both went
down on the same word&mdash;eulogism. I don&#8217;t see
the use of that &#8220;e.&#8221; Miss Clark gave us twenty
words which we had to bring into some stories
which we wrote. It was real fun to hear them.
Every one was different.</p>

<p>This evening as we sat before the fire place with
Grandmother, she taught us how to play &#8220;Cat&#8217;s
Cradle,&#8221; with a string on our fingers.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>December 25.</i>&mdash;Uncle Edward Richards sent us
a basket of lovely things from New York for
Christmas. Books and dresses for Anna and me,
a kaleidoscope, large cornucopias of candy, and
games, one of them being battledore and shuttlecock.
Grandmother says we will have to wait until spring
to play it, as it takes so much room. I wish all the
little girls in the world had an Uncle Edward.</p>

<p class='cln0'>1854</p>
</div>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>January 1, 1854.</i>&mdash;About fifty little boys and
girls at intervals knocked at the front door to-day,
to wish us Happy New Year. We had pennies and
cakes and apples ready for them. The pennies,
especially, seemed to attract them and we noticed the
same ones several times. Aunt Mary Carr made
lovely New Year cakes with a pretty flower stamped
on before they were baked.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>February</i> 4, 1854.&mdash;We heard to-day of the
death of our little half-sister, Julia Dey Richards, in
Penn Yan, yesterday, and I felt so sorry I couldn&#8217;t
sleep last night so I made up some verses about her
and this morning wrote them down and gave them to
Grandfather. He liked them so well he wanted me
to show them to Miss Clark and ask her to revise
them. I did and she said she would hand them to
her sister Mary to correct. When she handed them
back they were very much nicer than they were at
first and Grandfather had me copy them and he
pasted them into one of his Bibles to keep.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Anna and I went to call on Miss Upham
to-day. She is a real old lady and lives with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>her niece, Mrs. John Bates, on Gibson Street. Our
mother used to go to school to her at the Seminary.
Miss Upham said to Anna, &#8220;Your mother was a
lovely woman. You are not at all like her, dear.&#8221;
I told Anna she meant in looks I was sure, but Anna
was afraid she didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;Mr. Daggett&#8217;s text this morning was
the 22nd chapter of Revelation, 16th verse, &#8220;I am
the root and offspring of David and the bright and
morning star.&#8221; Mrs. Judge Taylor taught our Sunday
School class to-day and she said we ought not
to read our S. S. books on Sunday. I always do.
Mine to-day was entitled, &#8220;Cheap Repository Tracts
by Hannah More,&#8221; and it did not seem unreligious
at all.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;A gentleman visited our school to-day
whom we had never seen. Miss Clark introduced
him to us. When he came in, Miss Clark said,
&#8220;Young ladies,&#8221; and we all stood up and bowed
and said his name in concert. Grandfather says he
would rather have us go to school to Miss Clark
than any one else because she teaches us manners as
well as books. We girls think that he is a very particular
friend of Miss Clark. He is very nice looking,
but we don&#8217;t know where he lives. Laura
Chapin says he is an architect. I looked it up in
the dictionary and it says one who plans or designs.
I hope he does not plan to get married to Miss Clark
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>and take her away and break up the school, but I
presume he does, for that is usually the way.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;There was a minister preached in our
church last night and some people say he is the
greatest minister in the world. I think his name
was Mr. Finney. Grandmother said I could go
with our girl, Hannah White. We sat under the
gallery, in Miss Antoinette Pierson&#8217;s pew. There
was a great crowd and he preached good. Grandmother
says that our mother was a Christian when
she was ten years old and joined the church and she
showed us some sermons that mother used to write
down when she was seventeen years old, after she
came home from church, and she has kept them all
these years. I think children in old times were not
as bad as they are now.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Mrs. Judge Taylor sent for me to
come over to see her to-day. I didn&#8217;t know what
she wanted, but when I got there she said she wanted
to talk and pray with me on the subject of religion.
She took me into one of the wings. I never had
been in there before and was frightened at first, but
it was nice after I got used to it. After she prayed,
she asked me to, but I couldn&#8217;t think of anything
but &#8220;Now I lay me down to sleep,&#8221; and I was afraid
she would not like that, so I didn&#8217;t say anything.
When I got home and told Anna, she said, &#8220;Caroline,
I presume probably Mrs. Taylor wants you to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>be a Missionary, but I shan&#8217;t let you go.&#8221; I told her
she needn&#8217;t worry for I would have to stay at home
and look after her. After school to-night I went
out into Abbie Clark&#8217;s garden with her and she
taught me how to play &#8220;mumble te peg.&#8221; It is fun,
but rather dangerous. I am afraid Grandmother
won&#8217;t give me a knife to play with. Abbie Clark
has beautiful pansies in her garden and gave me
some roots.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>April 1.</i>&mdash;This is April Fool&#8217;s Day. It is not a
very pleasant day, but I am not very pleasant either.
I spent half an hour this morning very pleasantly
writing a letter to my Father but just as I had finished
it, Grandmother told me something to write
which I did not wish to and I spoke quite disrespectfully,
but I am real sorry and I won&#8217;t do so
any more.</p>

<p>Lucilla and Louisa Field were over to our house
to dinner to-day. We had a very good dinner indeed.
In the afternoon, Grandmother told me that
I might go over to Aunt Ann&#8217;s on condition that I
would not stay, but I stayed too long and got my
indian rubbers real muddy and Grandmother did
not like it. I then ate my supper and went to bed
at ten minutes to eight o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Monday, April 3.</i>&mdash;I got up this morning at quarter
before six o&#8217;clock. I then read my three chapters
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>in the Bible, and soon after ate my breakfast,
which consisted of ham and eggs and buckwheat
cakes. I then took a morning walk in the garden
and rolled my hoop. I went to school at quarter
before 9 o&#8217;clock. Miss Clark has us recite a verse
of scripture in response to roll call and my text for
the morning was the 8th verse of the 6th chapter of
Matthew, &#8220;Be ye not therefore like unto them; for
your Father knoweth what things ye have need of
before ye ask him.&#8221; We then had prayers. I then
began to write my composition and we had recess
soon after. In the afternoon I recited grammar,
wrote my dictation lesson and Dictionary lesson. I
was up third in my Dictionary class but missed two
words, and instead of being third in the class, I was
fifth. After supper I read my Sunday School book,
&#8220;A Shepherd&#8217;s Call to the Lambs of his Flock.&#8221; I
went to bed as usual at ten minutes to 8 o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>April</i> 4.&mdash;We went into our new schoolroom to-day
at Miss Clark&#8217;s school. It is a very nice room
and much larger than the one we occupied before.
Anna and I were sewing on our dolls&#8217; clothes this
afternoon and we talked so much that finally Grandmother
said, &#8220;the one that speaks first is the worst;
and the one that speaks last is the best.&#8221; We kept
still for quite a while, which gave Grandmother a
rest, but was very hard for us, especially Anna.
Pretty soon Grandmother forgot and asked us a
question, so we had the joke on her. Afterwards
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>Anna told me she would rather &#8220;be the worst,&#8221; than
to keep still so long again.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Grandmother sent Anna and me up
to Butcher Street after school to-day to invite Chloe
to come to dinner. I never saw so many black people
as there are up there. We saw old Lloyd and
black Jonathan and Dick Valentine and Jerusha and
Chloe and Nackie. Nackie was pounding up stones
into sand, to sell, to scour with. Grandmother
often buys it of her. I think Chloe was surprised,
but she said she would be ready, to-morrow, at
eleven o&#8217;clock, when the carriage came for her. I
should hate to be as fat as Chloe. I think she
weighs 300. She is going to sit in Grandfather&#8217;s
big arm chair, Grandmother says.</p>

<p>We told her we should think she would rather
invite white ladies, but she said Chloe was a poor
old slave and as Grandfather had gone to Saratoga
she thought it was a good time to have her. She
said God made of one blood all the people on the
face of the earth, so we knew she would do it and
we didn&#8217;t say any more. When we talk too much,
Grandfather always says N. C. (nuff ced). She
sent a carriage for Chloe and she came and had a
nice dinner, not in the kitchen either. Grandmother
asked her if there was any one else she would like
to see before she went home and she said, &#8220;Yes,
Miss Rebekah Gorham,&#8221; so she told the coachman
to take her down there and wait for her to make a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>call and then take her home and he did. Chloe said
she had a very nice time, so probably Grandmother
was all right as she generally is, but I could not be
as good as she is, if I should try one hundred
years.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>June.</i>&mdash;Our cousin, George Bates, of Honolulu,
came to see us to-day. He has one brother, Dudley,
but he didn&#8217;t come. George has just graduated
from college and is going to Japan to be a doctor.
He wrote such a nice piece in my album I must
copy it, &#8220;If I were a poet I would celebrate your
virtues in rhyme, if I were forty years old, I would
write a homily on good behavior; being neither, I
will quote two familiar lines which if taken as
a rule of action will make you a good and happy
woman:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<table summary='poetry' class='left2'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;Honor and shame from no condition rise,</p>
<p>Act well your part, there all the honor lies.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
</div>

<p>I think he is a very smart young man and will
make a good doctor to the heathen.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Grandfather took us down street to
be measured for some new patten leather shoes at
Mr. Ambler&#8217;s. They are going to be very nice ones
for best. We got our new summer hats from Mrs.
Freshour&#8217;s millinery and we wore them over to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>show to Aunt Ann and she said they were the very
handsomest bonnets she had seen this year.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;When we were on our way to school
this morning we met a lot of people and girls and
boys going to a picnic up the lake. They asked us
to go, too, but we said we were afraid we could not.
Mr. Alex. Howell said, &#8220;Tell your Grandfather I
will bring you back safe and sound unless the boat
goes to the bottom with all of us.&#8221; So we went
home and told Grandfather and much to our surprise
he said we could go. We had never been on
a boat or on the lake before. We went up to the
head on the steamer &#8220;<i>Joseph Wood</i>&#8221; and got off at
Maxwell&#8217;s Point. They had a picnic dinner and
lots of good things to eat. Then we all went into
the glen and climbed up through it. Mr. Alex.
Howell and Mrs. Wheeler got to the top first and
everybody gave three cheers. We had a lovely time
riding back on the boat and told Grandmother we
had the very best time we ever had in our whole
lives.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>May 26.</i>&mdash;There was an eclipse of the sun to-day
and we were very much excited looking at it. General
Granger came over and gave us some pieces of
smoked glass. Miss Clark wanted us to write compositions
about it so Anna wrote, &#8220;About eleven
o&#8217;clock we went out to see if it had come yet, but
it hadn&#8217;t come yet, so we waited awhile and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>looked again and it had come, and there was a piece
of it cut out of it.&#8221; Miss Clark said it was a very
good description and she knew Anna wrote it all
herself.</p>

<p>I handed in a composition, too, about the eclipse,
but I don&#8217;t think Miss Clark liked it as well as she
did Anna&#8217;s, because it had something in it about
&#8220;the beggarly elements of the world.&#8221; She asked
me where I got it and I told her that it was in a
nice story book that Grandmother gave me to read
entitled &#8220;Elizabeth Thornton or the Flower and
Fruit of Female Piety, and other sketches,&#8221; by Samuel
Irenaeus Prime. This was one of the other
sketches: It commenced by telling how the moon
came between the sun and the earth, and then went
on about the beggarly elements. Miss Clark
asked me if I knew what they meant and I told her
no, but I thought they sounded good. She just
smiled and never scolded me at all. I suppose next
time I must make it all up myself.</p>

<p>There is a Mr. Packer in town, who teaches all
the children to sing. He had a concert in Bemis
Hall last night and he put Anna on the top row of
the pyramid of beauty and about one hundred children
in rows below. She ought to have worn a
white dress as the others did but Grandmother said
her new pink barège would do. I curled her hair
all around in about thirty curls and she looked very
nice. She waved the flag in the shape of the letter
S and sang &#8220;The Star Spangled Banner,&#8221; and all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>the others joined in the chorus. It was perfectly
grand.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;When we were on our way to school
this morning we saw General Granger coming, and
Anna had on such a homely sunbonnet she took it
off and hid it behind her till he had gone by. When
we told Grandmother she said, &#8220;Pride goeth before
destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall.&#8221; I
never heard of any one who knew so many Bible
verses as Grandmother. Anna thought she would
be sorry for her and get her a new sunbonnet, but
she didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;We have Sunday School at nine o&#8217;clock
in the morning now. Grandfather loves to watch
us when we walk off together down the street, so
he walks back and forth on the front walk till we
come out, and gives us our money for the contribution.
This morning we had on our new white
dresses that Miss Rosewarne made and new summer
hats and new patten leather shoes and our mitts.
When he had looked us all over he said, with a
smile, &#8220;The Bible says, let your garments be always
white.&#8221; After we had gone on a little ways, Anna
said: &#8220;If Grandmother had thought of that verse
I wouldn&#8217;t have had to wear my pink barège dress
to the concert.&#8221; I told her she need not feel bad
about that now, for she sang as well as any of them
and looked just as good. She always believes everything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>I say, although she does not always do what
I tell her to. Mr. Noah T. Clarke told us in Sunday
School last Sunday that if we wanted to take
shares in the missionary ship, <i>Morning Star,</i> we
could buy them at 10 cents apiece, and Grandmother
gave us $1 to-day so we could have ten shares. We
got the certificate with a picture of the ship on it,
and we are going to keep it always. Anna says if
we pay the money, we don&#8217;t have to go.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;I almost forgot that it was Sunday
this morning and talked and laughed just as I do
week days. Grandmother told me to write down
this verse before I went to church so I would remember
it: &#8220;Keep thy foot when thou goest to
the house of God, and be more ready to hear than
to offer the sacrifice of fools.&#8221; I will remember it
now, sure. My feet are all right any way with my
new patten leather shoes on but I shall have to look
out for my head. Mr. Thomas Howell read a sermon
to-day as Mr. Daggett is out of town. Grandmother
always comes upstairs to get the candle and
tuck us in before she goes to bed herself, and some
nights we are sound asleep and do not hear her, but
last night we only pretended to be asleep. She
kneeled down by the bed and prayed aloud for us,
that we might be good children and that she might
have strength given to her from on high to guide us
in the straight and narrow path which leads to life
eternal. Those were her very words. After she
had gone downstairs we sat up in bed and talked
about it and promised each other to be good, and
crossed our hearts and &#8220;hoped to die&#8221; if we broke
our promise. Then Anna was afraid we would die,
but I told her I didn&#8217;t believe we would be as
good as that, so we kissed each other and went to
sleep.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;&#8220;Old Alice&#8221; was at our house to-day
and Grandmother gave her some flowers. She hid
them in her apron for she said if she should meet
any little children and they should ask for them she
would have to let them go. Mrs. Gooding was at
our house to-day and made a carpet. We went
over to Aunt Mary Carr&#8217;s this evening to see the
gas and the new chandeliers. They are brontz.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;My three chapters that I read this
morning were about Josiah&#8217;s zeal and reformation;
2nd, Jerusalem taken by Nebuchadnezzar; 3rd, Jerusalem
besieged and taken. The reason that we
always read the Bible the first thing in the morning
is because it says in the Bible, &#8220;Seek first the
kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these
things shall be added unto you.&#8221; Grandmother
says she hopes we will treasure up all these things
in our hearts and practice them in our lives. I hope
so, too. This morning Anna got very mad at one
of the girls and Grandmother told her she ought to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>return good for evil and heap coals of fire on her
head. Anna said she wished she could and burn
her all up, but I don&#8217;t think she meant it.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;I got up this morning at twenty
minutes after five. I always brush my teeth every
morning, but I forget to put it down here. I read
my three chapters in Job and played in the garden
and had time to read Grandmother a piece in the
paper about some poor children in New York.
Anna and I went over to Aunt Ann&#8217;s before school
and she gave us each two sticks of candy apiece.
Part of it came from New York and part from
Williamstown, Mass., where Henry goes to college.
Ann Eliza is going down street with us this afternoon
to buy us some new summer bonnets. They
are to be trimmed with blue and white and are to
come to five dollars. We are going to Mr. Stannard&#8217;s
store also, to buy us some stockings. I ought
to buy me a new thimble and scissors for I carried
my sewing to school to-day and they were inside of
it very carelessly and dropped out and got lost.
I ought to buy them with my own money, but I
haven&#8217;t got any, for I gave all I had (two shillings)
to Anna to buy Louisa Field a cornelian ring.
Perhaps Father will send me some money soon, but
I hate to ask him for fear he will rob himself. I
don&#8217;t like to tell Grandfather how very careless I
was, though I know he would say, &#8220;Accidents will
happen.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;I was up early this morning because
a dressmaker, Miss Willson, is coming to make me a
new calico dress. It is white with pink spots in it
and Grandfather bought it in New York. It is
very nice indeed and I think Grandfather was very
kind to get it for me. I had to stay at home from
school to be fitted. I helped sew and run my dress
skirt around the bottom and whipped it on the top.
I went to school in the afternoon, but did not have
my lessons very well. Miss Clark excused me because
I was not there in the morning. Some girls
got up on our fence to-day and walked clear across
it, the whole length. It is iron and very high and
has a stone foundation. Grandmother asked them
to get down, but I think they thought it was more
fun to walk up there than it was on the ground.
The name of the little girl that got up first was
Mary Lapham. She is Lottie Lapham&#8217;s cousin.
I made the pocket for my dress after I got home
from school and then Grandfather said he would
take us out to ride, so he took us way up to Thaddeus
Chapin&#8217;s on the hill. Julia Phelps was there,
playing with Laura Chapin, for she is her cousin.
Henry and Ann Eliza Field came over to call this
evening. Henry has come home from Williams
College on his vacation and he is a very pleasant
young man, indeed. I am reading a continued story
in <i>Harper&#8217;s Magazine</i>. It is called Little Dorritt, by
Charles Dickens, and is very interesting.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span><i>Friday, May.</i>&mdash;Miss Clark told us we could have
a picnic down to Sucker Brook this afternoon and
she told us to bring our rubbers and lunches by two
o&#8217;clock; but Grandmother was not willing to let us
go; not that she wished to deprive us of any pleasure
for she said instead we could wear our new black
silk basks and go with her to Preparatory lecture,
so we did, but when we got there we found that
Mr. Daggett was out of town so there was no meeting.
Then she told us we could keep dressed up and
go over to Aunt Mary Carr&#8217;s and take her some
apples, and afterwards Grandfather took us to ride
to see old Mrs. Sanborn and old Mr. and Mrs. Atwater.
He is ninety years old and blind and deaf,
so we had quite a good time after all.</p>

<p>Rev. Mr. Dickey, of Rochester, agent for the
Seaman&#8217;s Friend Society, preached this morning
about the poor little canal boy. His text was from
the 107th Psalm, 23rd verse, &#8220;They that go down
into the sea in ships.&#8221; He has the queerest voice
and stops off between his words. When we got
home Anna said she would show us how he preached
and she described what he said about a sailor in
time of war. She said, &#8220;A ball came&mdash;and struck
him there&mdash;another ball came&mdash;and struck him
there&mdash;he raised his faithful sword&mdash;and went on&mdash;to
victory&mdash;or death.&#8221; I expected Grandfather
would reprove her, but he just smiled a queer sort
of smile and Grandmother put her handkerchief up
to her face, as she always does when she is amused
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>about anything. I never heard her laugh out loud,
but I suppose she likes funny things as well as anybody.
She did just the same, this morning, when
Grandfather asked Anna where the sun rose, and
she said &#8220;over by Gen. Granger&#8217;s house and sets
behind the Methodist church.&#8221; She said she saw
it herself and should never forget it when any one
asked her which was east or west. I think she
makes up more things than any one I know of.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;Rev. M. L. R. P. Thompson preached
to-day. He used to be the minister of our church
before Mr. Daggett came. Some people call him
Rev. &#8220;Alphabet&#8221; Thompson, because he has so
many letters in his name. He preached a very good
sermon from the text, &#8220;Dearly beloved, as much as
lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.&#8221; I like to
hear him preach, but not as well as I do Mr. Daggett.
I suppose I am more used to him.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Edward Everett, of Boston, lectured
in our church this evening. They had a platform
built even with the tops of the pews, so he did not
have to go up into the pulpit. Crowds and crowds
came to hear him from all over everywhere.
Grandmother let me go. They say he is the most
eloquent speaker in the U. S., but I have heard
Mr. Daggett when I thought he was just as
good.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;We went to church to-day and heard
Rev. Mr. Stowe preach. His text was, &#8220;The poor
ye have with you always and whensoever ye will ye
may do them good.&#8221; I never knew any one who
liked to go to church as much as Grandmother does.
She says she &#8220;would rather be a doorkeeper in the
house of our God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.&#8221;
They don&#8217;t have women doorkeepers, and
I know she would not dwell a minute in a tent. Mr.
Coburn is the doorkeeper in our church and he rings
the bell every day at nine in the morning and at
twelve and at nine in the evening, so Grandfather
knows when it is time to cover up the fire in the
fireplace and go to bed. I think if the President
should come to call he would have to go home at
nine o&#8217;clock. Grandfather&#8217;s motto is:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<table summary='poetry' class='left2'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;Early to bed and early to rise</p>
<p>Makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
</div>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Mrs. Greig and Miss Chapin called to
see us to-day. Grandmother says that we can return
the calls as she does not visit any more. We
would like to, for we always enjoy dressing up and
making calls. Anna and I received two black veils
in a letter to-day from Aunt Caroline Dey. Just
exactly what we had wanted for a long while.
Uncle Edward sent us five dollars and Grandmother
said we could buy just what we wanted, so we went
down street to look at black silk mantillas. We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>went to Moore&#8217;s store and to Richardson&#8217;s and
to Collier&#8217;s, but they asked ten, fifteen or twenty dollars
for them, so Anna said she resolved from now,
henceforth and forever not to spend her money for
black silk mantillas.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;Rev. Mr. Tousley preached to-day to
the children and told us how many steps it took to
be bad. I think he said lying was first, then disobedience
to parents, breaking the Sabbath, swearing,
stealing, drunkenness. I don&#8217;t remember just
the order they came. It was very interesting, for
he told lots of stories and we sang a great many
times. I should think Eddy Tousley would be an
awful good boy with his father in the house with
him all the while, but probably he has to be away
part of the time preaching to other children.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;Uncle David Dudley Field and his
daughter, Mrs. Brewer, of Stockbridge, Mass., are
visiting us. Mrs. Brewer has a son, David Josiah,
who is in Yale College. After he graduates he is
going to be a lawyer and study in his Uncle David
Dudley Field&#8217;s office in New York. He was born
in Smyrna, Asia Minor, where his father and
mother were missionaries to the Greeks, in 1837.
Our Uncle David preached for Mr. Daggett this
afternoon. He is a very old man and left his sermon
at home and I had to go back after it. His
brother, Timothy, was the first minister in our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>church, about fifty years ago. Grandmother says
she came all the way from Connecticut with him
on horseback on a pillion behind him. Rather a
long ride, I should say. I heard her and Uncle
David talking about their childhood and how they
lived in Guilford, Conn., in a house that was built
upon a rock. That was some time in the last century
like the house that it tells about in the Bible
that was built on a rock.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday, August 10, 1854.</i>&mdash;Rev. Mr. Daggett&#8217;s
text this morning was, &#8220;Remember the Sabbath
day to keep it holy.&#8221; Grandmother said she
thought the sermon did not do us much good for
she had to tell us several times this afternoon to
stop laughing. Grandmother said we ought to be
good Sundays if we want to go to heaven, for there
it is one eternal Sabbath. Anna said she didn&#8217;t
want to be an angel just yet and I don&#8217;t think there
is the least danger of it, as far as I can judge.
Grandmother said there was another verse, &#8220;If we
do not have any pleasure on the Sabbath, or think
any thoughts, we shall ride on the high places of
the earth,&#8221; and Anna said she liked that better, for
she would rather ride than do anything else, so we
both promised to be good. Grandfather told us
they used to be more strict about Sunday than they
are now. Then he told us a story, how he had to
go to Geneva one Saturday morning in the stage
and expected to come back in the evening, but there
was an accident, so the stage did not come till Sunday
morning. Church had begun and he told the
stage driver to leave him right there, so he went
in late and the stage drove on. The next day he
heard that he was to come before the minister, Rev.
Mr. Johns, and the deacons and explain why he
had broken the fourth commandment. When he
got into the meeting Mr. Johns asked him what he
had to say, and he explained about the accident and
asked them to read a verse from the 8th chapter
of John, before they made up their minds what
to do to him. The verse was, &#8220;Let him that is
without sin among you cast the first stone.&#8221; Grandfather
said they all smiled, and the minister said
the meeting was out. Grandfather says that shows
it is better to know plenty of Bible verses, for some
time they may do you a great deal of good. We
then recited the catechism and went to bed.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span><i>August 21.</i>&mdash;Anna says that Alice Jewett feels
very proud because she has a little baby brother.
They have named him John Harvey Jewett after
his father, and Alice says when he is bigger she will
let Anna help her take him out to ride in his baby-carriage.
I suppose they will throw away their
dolls now.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Tuesday, September</i> 1.&mdash;I am sewing a sheet over
and over for Grandmother and she puts a pin in to
show me my stint, before I can go out to play.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>I am always glad when I get to it. I am making
a sampler, too, and have all the capital letters worked
and now will make the small ones. It is done in
cross stitch on canvas with different color silks. I
am going to work my name, too. I am also knitting
a tippet on some wooden needles that Henry Carr
made for me. Grandmother has raveled it out
several times because I dropped stitches. It is
rather tedious, but she says, &#8220;If at first you don&#8217;t
succeed, try, try again.&#8221; Some military soldiers
went by the house to-day and played some beautiful
music. Grandfather has a teter and swing for us
in the back yard and we enjoy them usually, but
to-night Anna slid off the teter board when she was
on the ground and I was in the air and I came down
sooner than I expected. There was a hand organ
and monkey going by and she was in a hurry to get
to the street to see it. She got there a good while
before I did. The other day we were swinging
and Grandmother called us in to dinner, but Anna
said we could not go until we &#8220;let the old cat die.&#8221;
Grandmother said it was more important that we
should come when we are called.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>October.</i>&mdash;Grandmother&#8217;s name is Abigail, but she
was always called &#8220;Nabby&#8221; at home. Some of
the girls call me &#8220;Carrie,&#8221; but Grandmother prefers
&#8220;Caroline.&#8221; She told us to-day, how when she
was a little girl, down in Connecticut in 1794, she
was on her way to school one morning and she saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>an Indian coming and was so afraid, but did not
dare run for fear he would chase her. So she
thought of the word sago, which means &#8220;good
morning,&#8221; and when she got up close to him she
dropped a curtesy and said &#8220;Sago,&#8221; and he just
went right along and never touched her at all. She
says she hopes we will always be polite to every
one, even to strangers.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>November.</i>&mdash;Abbie Clark&#8217;s father has been elected
Governor and she is going to Albany to live, for a
while. We all congratulated her when she came to
school this morning, but I am sorry she is going
away. We will write to each other every week.
She wrote a prophecy and told the girls what they
were going to be and said I should be mistress of
the White House. I think it will happen, about the
same time that Anna goes to be a missionary.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>December.</i>&mdash;There was a moonlight sleigh-ride of
boys and girls last night, but Grandfather did not
want us to go, but to-night he said he was going to
take us to one himself. So after supper he told
Mr. Piser to harness the horse to the cutter and
bring it around to the front gate. Mr. Piser takes
care of our horse and the Methodist Church. He
lives in the basement. Grandfather sometimes calls
him Shakespeare to us, but I don&#8217;t know why. He
doesn&#8217;t look as though he wrote poetry. Grandfather
said he was going to take us out to Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>Waterman Powers&#8217; in Farmington and he did.
They were quite surprised to see us, but very glad
and gave us apples and doughnuts and other good
things. We saw Anne and Imogene and Morey
and one little girl named Zimmie. They wanted us
to stay all night, but Grandmother was expecting
us. We got home safe about ten o&#8217;clock and had
a very nice time. We never sat up so late before.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Wednesday, January</i> 9.&mdash;I came downstairs this
morning at ten minutes after seven, almost frozen.
I never spent such a cold night before in all my life.
It is almost impossible to get warm even in the
dining-room. The thermometer is 10° below zero.
The schoolroom was so cold that I had to keep my
cloak on. I spoke a piece this afternoon. It was
&#8220;The Old Arm Chair,&#8221; by Eliza Cook. It begins,
&#8220;I love it, I love it, and who shall dare to chide
me for loving that old arm chair?&#8221; I love it because
it makes me think of Grandmother. After
school to-night Anna and I went downtown to buy
a writing book, but we were so cold we thought we
would never get back. Anna said she knew her
toes were frozen. We got as far as Mr. Taylor&#8217;s
gate and she said she could not get any farther; but
I pulled her along, for I could not bear to have her
perish in sight of home. We went to bed about
eight o&#8217;clock and slept very nicely indeed, for
Grandmother put a good many blankets on and we
were warm.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>January</i> 23.&mdash;This evening after reading one of
Dickens&#8217; stories I knit awhile on my mittens. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>have not had nice ones in a good while. Grandmother
cut out the ones that I am wearing of white
flannel, bound round the wrist with blue merino.
They are not beautiful to be sure, but warm and
will answer all purposes until I get some that are
better. When I came home from school to-day
Mrs. Taylor was here. She noticed how tall I was
growing and said she hoped that I was as good as
I was tall. A very good wish, I am sure.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday, January</i> 29.&mdash;Mr. Daggett preached this
morning from the text, Deut. 8: 2: &#8220;And thou
shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God
led thee.&#8221; It is ten years to-day since Mr. Daggett
came to our church, and he told how many deaths
there had been, and how many baptisms, and how
many members had been added to the church. It
was a very interesting sermon, and everybody hoped
Mr. Daggett would stay here ten years more, or
twenty, or thirty, or always. He is the only minister
that I ever had, and I don&#8217;t ever want any other.
We never could have any one with such a voice as
Mr. Daggett&#8217;s, or such beautiful eyes. Then he has
such good sermons, and always selects the hymns
we like best, and reads them in such a way. This
morning they sang: &#8220;Thus far the Lord has led
me on, thus far His power prolongs my days.&#8221;
After he has been away on a vacation he always
has for the first hymn, and we always turn to it
before he gives it out:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<table summary='poetry' class='left2'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;Upward I lift mine eyes,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>From God is all my aid;</p>
<p>The God that built the skies,</p>
<p>And earth and nature made.</p>
<hr class='poetry' />
<p style='margin-left:2ex'>  &#8220;God is the tower</p>
<p style='margin-left:2ex'>  To which I fly</p>
<p style='margin-left:2ex'>  His grace is nigh</p>
<p style='margin-left:2ex'>  In every hour.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
</div>

<p>He always prays for the oil of joy for mourning
and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>January,</i> 1855.&mdash;Johnny Lyon is dead. Georgia
Wilkinson cried awfully in school because she said
she was engaged to him.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>April.</i>&mdash;Grandmother received a letter from Connecticut
to-day telling of the death of her only sister.
She was knitting before she got it and she laid it
down a few moments and looked quite sad and said,
&#8220;So sister Anna is dead.&#8221; Then after a little she
went on with her work. Anna watched her and
when we were alone she said to me, &#8220;Caroline, some
day when you are about ninety you may be eating
an apple or reading or doing something and you will
get a letter telling of my decease and after you have
read it you will go on as usual and just say, &#8216;So sister
Anna is dead.&#8217;&#8221; I told her that I knew if I lived
to be a hundred and heard that she was dead I
should cry my eyes out, if I had any.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span><i>May.</i>&mdash;Father has sent us a box of fruit from
New Orleans. Prunes, figs, dates and oranges, and
one or two pomegranates. We never saw any of
the latter before. They are full of cells with jelly
in, very nice. He also sent some seeds of sensitive
plant, which we have sown in our garden.</p>

<p>This evening I wrote a letter to John and a little
&#8220;poetry&#8221; to Father, but it did not amount to much.
I am going to write some a great deal better some
day. Grandfather had some letters to write this
morning, and got up before three o&#8217;clock to write
them! He slept about three-quarters of an hour to-night
in his chair.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;There was a stranger preached for Dr.
Daggett this morning and his text was, &#8220;Man looketh
upon the outward appearance but the Lord looketh
on the heart.&#8221; When we got home Anna said
the minister looked as though he had been sick from
birth and his forehead stretched from his nose to
the back of his neck, he was so bald. Grandmother
told her she ought to have been more interested in
his words than in his looks, and that she must have
very good eyes if she could see all that from our
pew, which is the furthest from the pulpit of any
in church, except Mr. Gibson&#8217;s, which is just the
same. Anna said she couldn&#8217;t help seeing it unless
she shut her eyes, and then every one would think
she had gone to sleep. We can see the Academy
boys from our pew, too.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>Mr. Lathrop, of the seminary, is superintendent
of the Sunday School now and he had a present to-day
from Miss Betsey Chapin, and several visitors
came in to see it presented: Dr. Daggett, Mr. and
Mrs. Alex. Howell, Mr. Tousley, Mr. Stowe, Mr.
and Mrs. Gideon Granger and several others. The
present was a certificate of life membership to something;
I did not hear what. It was just a large piece
of parchment, but they said it cost $25. Miss Lizzie
Bull is my Sunday School teacher now. She asked
us last Sunday to look up a place in the Bible where
the trees held a consultation together, to see which
one should reign over them. I did not remember
any such thing, but I looked it up in the concordance
and found it in Judges 9: 8. I found the meaning
of it in Scott&#8217;s Commentary and wrote it down and
she was very much pleased, and told us next Sunday
to find out all about Absalom.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>July.</i>&mdash;Our sensitive plant is growing nicely and
it is quite a curiosity. It has fern-like leaves and
when we touch them, they close, but soon come out
again. Anna and I keep them performing.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>September</i> 1.&mdash;Anna and I go to the seminary
now. Mr. Richards and Mr. Tyler are the principals.
Anna fell down and sprained her ankle to-day
at the seminary, and had to be carried into Mrs.
Richards&#8217; library. She was sliding down the bannisters
with little Annie Richards. I wonder what
she will do next. She has good luck in the gymnasium
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>and can beat Emma Wheeler and Jennie
Ruckle swinging on the pole and climbing the rope
ladder, although they and Sarah Antes are about as
spry as squirrels and they are all good at ten pins.
Susie Daggett and Lucilla Field have gone to Farmington,
Conn., to school.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;I received a letter from my brother
John in New Orleans, and his ambrotype. He has
grown amazingly. He also sent me a N. O. paper
and it gave an account of the public exercises in the
school, and said John spoke a piece called &#8220;The
Baron&#8217;s Last Banquet,&#8221; and had great applause and
it said he was &#8220;a chip off the old block.&#8221; He is a
very nice boy, I know that. James is sixteen years
old now and is in Princeton College. He is studying
German and says he thinks he will go to Germany
some day and finish his education, but I guess in
that respect he will be very much disappointed.
Germany is a great ways off and none of our relations
that I ever heard of have ever been there and
it is not at all likely that any of them ever will.
Grandfather says, though, it is better to aim too high
than not high enough. James is a great boy to
study. They had their pictures taken together once
and John was holding some flowers and James a
book and I guess he has held on to it ever since.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;Polly Peck looked so funny on the
front seat of the gallery. She had on one of Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>Greig&#8217;s bonnets and her lace collar and cape and
mitts. She used to be a milliner so she knows how
to get herself up in style. The ministers have appointed
a day of fasting and prayer and Anna asked
Grandmother if it meant to eat as fast as you can.
Grandmother was very much surprised.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>November</i> 25.&mdash;I helped Grandmother get ready
for Thanksgiving Day by stoning some raisins and
pounding some cloves and cinnamon in the mortar
pestle pounder. It is quite a job. I have been
writing with a quill pen but I don&#8217;t like it because it
squeaks so. Grandfather made us some to-day and
also bought us some wafers to seal our letters with,
and some sealing wax and a stamp with &#8220;R&#8221; on it.
He always uses the seal on his watch fob with &#8220;B.&#8221;
He got some sand, too. Our inkstand is double and
has one bottle for ink and the other for sand to dry
the writing.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>December</i> 20, 1855.&mdash;Susan B. Anthony is in
town and spoke in Bemis Hall this afternoon. She
made a special request that all the seminary girls
should come to hear her as well as all the women and
girls in town. She had a large audience and she
talked very plainly about our rights and how we
ought to stand up for them, and said the world
would never go right until the women had just as
much right to vote and rule as the men. She asked
us all to come up and sign our names who would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>promise to do all in our power to bring about that
glad day when equal rights should be the law of
the land. A whole lot of us went up and signed the
paper. When I told Grandmother about it she said
she guessed Susan B. Anthony had forgotten that
St. Paul said the women should keep silence. I told
her, no, she didn&#8217;t for she spoke particularly about
St. Paul and said if he had lived in these times,
instead of 1800 years ago, he would have been as
anxious to have the women at the head of the government
as she was. I could not make Grandmother
agree with her at all and she said we might
better all of us stayed at home. We went to prayer
meeting this evening and a woman got up and
talked. Her name was Mrs. Sands. We hurried
home and told Grandmother and she said she probably
meant all right and she hoped we did not laugh.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;I told Grandfather if he would bring
me some sheets of foolscap paper I would begin to
write a book. So he put a pin on his sleeve to remind
him of it and to-night he brought me a whole
lot of it. I shall begin it to-morrow. This evening
I helped Anna do her Arithmetic examples, and read
her Sunday School book. The name of it is
&#8220;Watch and Pray.&#8221; My book is the second volume
of &#8220;Stories on the Shorter Catechism.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;I decided to copy a lot of choice stories
and have them printed and say they were &#8220;compiled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>by Caroline Cowles Richards,&#8221; it is so much easier
than making them up. I spent three hours to-day
copying one and am so tired I think I shall give it up.
When I told Grandmother she looked disappointed
and said my ambition was like &#8220;the morning cloud
and the early dew,&#8221; for it soon vanished away. Anna
said it might spring up again and bear fruit a hundredfold.
Grandfather wants us to amount to
something and he buys us good books whenever he
has a chance. He bought me Miss Caroline Chesebro&#8217;s
book, &#8220;The Children of Light,&#8221; and Alice and
Phoebe Cary&#8217;s <i>Poems</i>. He is always reading Channing&#8217;s
memoirs and sermons and Grandmother
keeps &#8220;Lady Huntington and Her Friends,&#8221; next to
&#8220;Jay&#8217;s Morning and Evening Exercises&#8221; and her
Testament. Anna told Grandmother that she saw
Mrs. George Willson looking very steadily at us in
prayer meeting the other night and she thought
she might be planning to &#8220;write us up.&#8221; Grandmother
said she did not think Mrs. Willson was so
short of material as that would imply, and she
feared she had some other reason for looking at us.
I think dear Grandmother has a little grain of sarcasm
in her nature, but she only uses it on extra
occasions. Anna said, &#8220;Oh, no; she wrote the lives
of the three Mrs. Judsons and I thought she might
like for a change to write the biographies of the
&#8216;two Miss Richards.&#8217;&#8221; Anna has what might be
called a vivid imagination.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 23.&mdash;This is the third morning that I
have come down stairs at exactly twenty minutes
to seven. I went to school all day. Mary Paul and
Fannie Palmer read &#8220;<i>The Snow Bird</i>&#8221; to-day.
There were some funny things in it. One was:
&#8220;Why is a lady&#8217;s hair like the latest news? Because
in the morning we always find it in the papers.&#8221;
Another was: &#8220;One rod makes an acher,
as the boy said when the schoolmaster flogged him.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is Allie Field&#8217;s birthday. He got a pair of
slippers from Mary with the soles all on; a pair of
mittens from Miss Eliza Chapin, and Miss Rebecca
Gorham is going to give him a pair of stockings
when she gets them done.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>January</i> 30.&mdash;I came home from school at eleven
o&#8217;clock this morning and learned a piece to speak
this afternoon, but when I got up to school I forgot
it, so I thought of another one. Mr. Richards said
that he must give me the praise of being the best
speaker that spoke in the afternoon. Ahem!</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>February</i> 6.&mdash;We were awakened very early this
morning by the cry of fire and the ringing of bells
and could see the sky red with flames and knew it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>was the stores and we thought they were all burning
up. Pretty soon we heard our big brass door
knocker being pounded fast and Grandfather said,
&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; &#8220;Melville Arnold for the bank
keys,&#8221; we heard. Grandfather handed them out
and dressed as fast as he could and went down,
while Anna and I just lay there and watched the
flames and shook. He was gone two or three hours
and when he came back he said that Mr. Palmer&#8217;s
hat store, Mr. Underhill&#8217;s book store, Mr. Shafer&#8217;s
tailor shop, Mrs. Smith&#8217;s millinery, Pratt &amp; Smith&#8217;s
drug store, Mr. Mitchell&#8217;s dry goods store, two
printing offices and a saloon were burned. It was
a very handsome block. The bank escaped fire, but
the wall of the next building fell on it and crushed
it. After school to-night Grandmother let us go
down to see how the fire looked. It looked very
sad indeed. Judge Taylor offered Grandfather one
of the wings of his house for the bank for the present
but he has secured a place in Mr. Buhre&#8217;s store
in the Franklin Block.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Thursday, February</i> 7.&mdash;Dr. and Aunt Mary Carr
and Uncle Field and Aunt Ann were over at our
house to dinner to-day and we had a fine fish dinner,
not one of Gabriel&#8217;s (the man who blows such a
blast through the street, they call him Gabriel), but
one that Mr. Francis Granger sent to us. It was
elegant. Such a large one it covered a big platter.
This evening General Granger came in and brought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>a gentleman with him whose name was Mr. Skinner.
They asked Grandfather, as one of the trustees of
the church, if he had any objection to a deaf and
dumb exhibition there to-morrow night. He had
no objection, so they will have it and we will go.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;We went and liked it very much. The
man with them could talk and he interpreted it.
There were two deaf and dumb women and three
children. They performed very prettily, but the
smartest boy did the most. He acted out David killing
Goliath and the story of the boy stealing apples
and how the old man tried to get him down by
throwing grass at him, but finding that would not
do, he threw stones which brought the boy down
pretty quick. Then he acted a boy going fishing
and a man being shaved in a barber shop and several
other things. I laughed out loud in school to-day
and made some pictures on my slate and showed
them to Clara Willson and made her laugh, and
then we both had to stay after school. Anna was at
Aunt Ann&#8217;s to supper to-night to meet a little girl
named Helen Bristol, of Rochester. Ritie Tyler
was there, too, and they had a lovely time.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span><i>February</i> 8.&mdash;I have not written in my journal
for several days, because I never like to write things
down if they don&#8217;t go right. Anna and I were
invited to go on a sleigh-ride, Tuesday night, and
Grandfather said he did not want us to go. We
asked him if we could spend the evening with
Frankie Richardson and he said yes, so we went
down there and when the load stopped for her, we
went too, but we did not enjoy ourselves at all and
did not join in the singing. I had no idea that
sleigh-rides could make any one feel so bad. It was
not very cold, but I just shivered all the time.
When the nine o&#8217;clock bell rang we were up by the
&#8220;Northern Retreat,&#8221; and I was so glad when we got
near home so we could get out. Grandfather and
Grandmother asked us if we had a nice time, but
we got to bed as quick as we could. The next day
Grandfather went into Mr. Richardson&#8217;s store and
told him he was glad he did not let Frankie go on
the sleigh-ride, and Mr. Richardson said he did let
her go and we went too. We knew how it was
when we got home from school, because they acted
so sober, and, after a while, Grandmother talked
with us about it. We told her we were sorry and
we did not have a bit good time and would never
do it again. When she prayed with us the next
morning, as she always does before we go to school,
she said, &#8220;Prepare us, Lord, for what thou art preparing
for us,&#8221; and it seemed as though she was
discouraged, but she said she forgave us. I know
one thing, we will never run away to any more
sleigh-rides.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>February</i> 20.&mdash;Mr. Worden, Mrs. Henry Chesebro&#8217;s
father, was buried to-day, and Aunt Ann let
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>Allie stay with us while she went to the funeral. I
am going to Fannie Gaylord&#8217;s party to-morrow
night.</p>

<p>I went to school this afternoon and kept the rules,
so to-night I had the satisfaction of saying &#8220;perfect&#8221;
when called upon, and if I did not like to
keep the rules, it is some pleasure to say that.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>February</i> 21.&mdash;We had a very nice time at Fannie
Gaylord&#8217;s party and a splendid supper. Lucilla
Field laughed herself almost to pieces when she
found on going home that she had worn her leggins
all the evening. We had a pleasant walk home but
did not stay till it was out. Some one asked me if
I danced every set and I told them no, I set every
dance. I told Grandmother and she was very
much pleased. Some one told us that Grandfather
and Grandmother first met at a ball in the early
settlement of Canandaigua. I asked her if it was
so and she said she never had danced since she became
a professing Christian and that was more than
fifty years ago.</p>

<p>Grandfather heard to-day of the death of his sister,
Lydia, who was Mrs. Lyman Beecher. She
was Rev. Dr. Lyman Beecher&#8217;s third wife. Grandmother
says that they visited her once and she was
quite nervous thinking about having such a great
man as Dr. Lyman Beecher for her guest, as he was
considered one of the greatest men of his day, but
she said she soon got over this feeling, for he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>so genial and pleasant and she noticed particularly
how he ran up and down stairs like a boy. I think
that is very apt to be the way for &#8220;men are only
boys grown tall.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a Know Nothing convention in town
to-day. They don&#8217;t want any one but Americans to
hold office, but I guess they will find that foreigners
will get in. Our hired man is an Irishman and I
think he would just as soon be &#8220;Prisidint&#8221; as not.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>February</i> 22.&mdash;This is such a beautiful day, the
girls wanted a holiday, but Mr. Richards would not
grant it. We told him it was Washington&#8217;s birthday
and we felt very patriotic, but he was inexorable.
We had a musical review and literary exercises
instead in the afternoon and I put on my blue
merino dress and my other shoes. Anna dressed
up, too, and I curled her hair. The Primary scholars
sit upstairs this term and do not have to pay
any more. Anna and Emma Wheeler like it very
much, but they do not sit together. We are seated
alphabetically, and I sit with Mary Reznor and Anna
with Mittie Smith. They thought she would behave
better, I suppose, if they put her with one of the
older girls, but I do not know as it will have the
&#8220;desired effect,&#8221; as Grandmother says. Miss Mary
Howell and Miss Carrie Hart and Miss Lizzie and
Miss Mollie Bull were visitors this afternoon. Gertrude
Monier played and sang. Mrs. Anderson is
the singing teacher. Marion Maddox and Pussie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>Harris and Mary Daniels played on the piano. Mr.
Hardick is the teacher, and he played too. You
would think he was trying to pound the piano all
to pieces but he is a good player. We have two
papers kept up at school, <i>The Snow Bird</i> and <i>The
Waif</i>&mdash;one for the younger and the other for the
older girls. Miss Jones, the composition teacher,
corrects them both. Kate Buell and Anna Maria
Chapin read <i>The Waif</i> to-day and Gusta Buell and
I read <i>The Snow Bird</i>. She has beautiful curls and
has two nice brothers also, Albert and Arthur, and
the girls all like them. They have not lived in town
very long.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>February</i> 25.&mdash;I guess I won&#8217;t fill up my journal
any more by saying I arose this morning at the usual
time, for I don&#8217;t think it is a matter of life or death
whether I get up at the usual time or a few minutes
later and when I am older and read over the account
of the manner in which I occupied my time in my
younger days I don&#8217;t think it will add particularly
to the interest to know whether I used to get up
at 7 or at a quarter before. I think Miss Sprague,
our schoolroom teacher, would have been glad if
none of us had got up at all this morning for we
acted so in school. She does not want any noise
during the three minute recess, but there has been a
good deal all day. In singing class they disturbed
Mr. Kimball by blowing through combs. We took
off our round combs and put paper over them and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>then blew&mdash;Mary Wheeler and Lottie Lapham and
Anna sat nearest me and we all tried to do it, but
Lottie was the only one who could make it go. He
thought we all did, so he made us come up and sit
by him. I did not want to a bit. He told Miss
Sprague of us and she told the whole school if there
was as much noise another day she would keep
every one of us an hour after half-past 4. As soon
as she said this they all began to groan. She said
&#8220;Silence.&#8221; I only made the least speck of a noise
that no one heard.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>February</i> 26.&mdash;To-night, after singing class, Mr.
Richards asked all who blew through combs to rise.
I did not, because I could not make it go, but when
he said all who groaned could rise, I did, and some
others, but not half who did it. He kept us very
late and we all had to sign an apology to Miss
Sprague.</p>

<p>Grandfather made me a present of a beautiful
blue stone to-day called Malachite. Anna said she
always thought Malachite was one of the prophets.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>March</i> 3, 1856.&mdash;Elizabeth Spencer sits with me
in school now. She is full of fun but always manages
to look very sober when Miss Chesebro looks
up to see who is making the noise over our way.
I never seem to have that knack. Anna had to stay
after school last night and she wrote in her journal
that the reason was because &#8220;nature will out&#8221; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>because &#8220;she whispered and didn&#8217;t have her lessons,
etc., etc., etc.&#8221; Mr. Richards has allowed us to
bring our sewing to school but now he says we cannot
any more. I am sorry for I have some embroidery
and I could get one pantalette done in a
week, but now it will take me longer. Grandmother
has offered me one dollar if I will stitch a linen
shirt bosom and wrist bands for Grandfather and
make the sleeves. I have commenced but, Oh my!
it is an undertaking. I have to pull the threads out
and then take up two threads and leave three. It is
very particular work and Anna says the stitches
must not be visible to the naked eye. I have to fell
the sleeves with the tiniest seams and stroke all the
gathers and put a stitch on each gather. Minnie
Bellows is the best one in school with her needle and
is a dabster at patching. She cut a piece right out
of her new calico dress and matched a new piece in
and none of us could tell where it was. I am sure
it would not be safe for me to try that. Grandmother
let me ask three of the girls to dinner Saturday,
Abbie Clark, Mary Wheeler and Mary Field.
We had a big roast turkey and everything else to
match. Good enough for Queen Victoria. That
reminds me of a conundrum we had in <i>The Snow
Bird:</i> What does Queen Victoria take her pills in?
In cider. (Inside her.)</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>March</i> 7.&mdash;The reports were read at school to-day
and mine was, Attendance 10, Deportment 8, Scholarship
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>7½, and Anna&#8217;s 10, 10 and 7. I think they
got it turned around, for Anna has not behaved anything
uncommon lately.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>March</i> 10.&mdash;My teacher Miss Sprague kept me
after school to-night for whispering, and after all
the others were gone she came to my seat and put
her arm around me and kissed me and said she loved
me very much and hoped I would not whisper in
school any more. This made me feel very sorry
and I told her I would try my best, but it seemed
as though it whispered itself sometimes. I think
she is just as nice as she can be and I shall tell the
other girls so. Her home is in Glens Falls.</p>

<p>Anna jumped the rope two hundred times to-day
without stopping, and I told her that I read of a girl
who did that and then fell right down stone dead.
I don&#8217;t believe Anna will do it again. If she does
I shall tell Grandmother.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>April</i> 5.&mdash;I walked down town with Grandfather
this morning and it is such a beautiful day I felt
glad that I was alive. The air was full of tiny little
flies, buzzing around and going in circles and semicircles
as though they were practising calisthenics or
dancing a quadrille. I think they were glad they
were alive, too. I stepped on a big bug crawling on
the walk and Grandfather said I ought to have
brushed it aside instead of killing it. I asked him
why and he said, &#8220;Shakespeare says, &#8216;The beetle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>that we tread upon feels a pang as great as when a
giant dies.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>A man came to our door the other day and asked
if &#8220;Deacon&#8221; Beals was at home. I asked Grandmother
afterwards if Grandfather was a Deacon
and she said no and never had been, that people gave
him the name when he was a young man because
he was so staid and sober in his appearance. Some
one told me once that I would not know my Grandfather
if I should meet him outside the Corporation.
I asked why and he said because he was so genial
and told such good stories. I told him that was just
the way he always is at home. I do not know any
one who appreciates real wit more than he does.
He is quite strong in his likes and dislikes, however.
I have heard him say,</p>

<p>Bessie Seymour wore a beautiful gold chain to
school this morning and I told Grandmother that I
wanted one just like it. She said that outward
adornments were not of as much value as inward
graces and the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit,
in the sight of the Lord, was of great price. I know
it is very becoming to Grandmother and she wears
it all the time but I wish I had a gold chain just
the same.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>Aunt Ann received a letter to-day from Lucilla,
who is at Miss Porter&#8217;s school at Farmington, Connecticut.
She feels as if she were a Christian and
that she has experienced religion.</p>

<p>Grandfather noticed how bright and smart Bentley
Murray was, on the street, and what a business
way he had, so he applied for a place for him as page
in the Legislature at Albany and got it. He is
always noticing young people and says, &#8220;As the
twig is bent, the tree is inclined.&#8221; He says we may
be teachers yet if we are studious now. Anna says,
&#8220;Excuse me, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grandmother knows the Bible from Genesis to
Revelation excepting the &#8220;begats&#8221; and the hard
names, but Anna told her a new verse this morning,
&#8220;At Parbar westward, four at the causeway and
two at Parbar.&#8221; Grandmother put her spectacles
up on her forehead and just looked at Anna as
though she had been talking in Chinese. She finally
said, &#8220;Anna, I do not think that is in the Bible.&#8221;
She said, &#8220;Yes, it is; I found it in 1 Chron. 26: 18.&#8221;
Grandmother found it and then she said Anna had
better spend her time looking up more helpful texts.
Anna then asked her if she knew who was the shortest
man mentioned in the Bible and Grandmother
said &#8220;Zaccheus.&#8221; Anna said that she just read in
the newspaper, that one said &#8220;Nehimiah was&#8221; and
another said &#8220;Bildad the Shuhite&#8221; and another said
&#8220;Tohi.&#8221; Grandmother said it was very wicked to
pervert the Scripture so, and she did not approve of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>it at all. I don&#8217;t think Anna will give Grandmother
any more Bible conundrums.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>April</i> 12.&mdash;We went down town this morning and
bought us some shaker bonnets to wear to school.
They cost $1 apiece and we got some green silk for
capes to put on them. We fixed them ourselves
and wore them to school and some of the girls liked
them and some did not, but it makes no difference
to me what they like, for I shall wear mine till it
is worn out. Grandmother says that if we try to
please everybody we please nobody. The girls are
all having mystic books at school now and they are
very interesting to have. They are blank books and
we ask the girls and boys to write in them and then
they fold the page twice over and seal it with wafers
or wax and then write on it what day it is to be
opened. Some of them say, &#8220;Not to be opened for
a year,&#8221; and that is a long time to wait. If we cannot
wait we can open them and seal them up again.
I think Anna did look to see what Eugene Stone
wrote in hers, for it does not look as smooth as it
did at first. We have autograph albums too and
Horace Finley gave us lots of small photographs.
We paste them in the books and then ask the people
to write their names. We have got Miss Upham&#8217;s
picture and Dr. and Mrs. Daggett, General
Granger&#8217;s and Hon. Francis Granger&#8217;s and Mrs.
Adele Granger Thayer and Friend Burling, Dr.
Jewett, Dr. Cheney, Deacon Andrews and Dr. Carr,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>and Johnnie Thompson&#8217;s, Mr. Noah T. Clarke, Mr.
E. M. Morse, Mrs. George Willson, Theodore Barnum,
Jim Paton&#8217;s and Will Schley, Merritt Wilcox,
Tom Raines, Ed. Williams, Gus Coleman&#8217;s, W. P.
Fisk and lots of the girls&#8217; pictures besides. Eugene
Stone and Tom Eddy had their ambrotypes taken
together, in a handsome case, and gave it to Anna.
We are going to keep them always.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>April</i>.&mdash;The Siamese twins are in town and a lot
of the girls went to see them in Bemis Hall this
afternoon. It costs 10 cents. Grandmother let us
go. Their names are Eng and Chang and they are
not very handsome. They are two men joined together.
I hope they like each other but I don&#8217;t envy
them any way. If one wanted to go somewhere and
the other one didn&#8217;t I don&#8217;t see how they would manage
it. One would have to give up, that&#8217;s certain.
Perhaps they are both Christians.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>April</i> 30.&mdash;Rev. Henry M. Field, editor of the
<i>New York Evangelist,</i> and his little French wife are
here visiting. She is a wonderful woman. She has
written a book and paints beautiful pictures and was
teacher of art in Cooper Institute, New York. He
is Grandmother&#8217;s nephew and he brought her a picture
of himself and his five brothers, taken for
Grandmother, because she is the only aunt they have
in the world. The rest are all dead. The men in
the picture are Jonathan and Matthew and David
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>Dudley and Stephen J. and Cyrus W. and Henry M.
They are all very nice looking and Grandmother
thinks a great deal of the picture.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>May</i> 15.&mdash;Miss Anna Gaylord is one of my teachers
at the seminary and when I told her that I wrote
a journal every day she wanted me to bring her my
last book and let her read it. I did so and she said
she enjoyed it very much and she hoped I would
keep them for they would be interesting for me to
read when I am old. I think I shall do so. She has
a very particular friend, Rev. Mr. Beaumont, who is
one of the teachers at the Academy. I think they
are going to be married some day. I guess I will
show her this page of my journal, too. Grandmother
let me make a pie in a saucer to-day and it
was very good.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>May</i>.&mdash;We were invited to Bessie Seymour&#8217;s
party last night and Grandmother said we could go.
The girls all told us at school that they were going
to wear low neck and short sleeves. We have caps
on the sleeves of our best dresses and we tried to get
the sleeves out, so we could go bare arms, but we
couldn&#8217;t get them out. We had a very nice time,
though, at the party. Some of the Academy boys
were there and they asked us to dance but of course
we couldn&#8217;t do that. We promenaded around the
rooms and went out to supper with them. Eugene
Stone and Tom Eddy asked to go home with us but
Grandmother sent our two girls for us, Bridget
Flynn and Hannah White, so they couldn&#8217;t. We
were quite disappointed, but perhaps she won&#8217;t send
for us next time.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span><i>May.</i>&mdash;Grandmother is teaching me how to knit
some mittens now, but if I ever finish them it will
be through much tribulation, the way they have to
be raveled out and commenced over again. I think
I shall know how to knit when I get through, if I
never know how to do anything else. Perhaps I
shall know how to write, too, for I write all of
Grandmother&#8217;s letters for her, because it tires her to
write too much. I have sorted my letters to-day
and tied them in packages and found I had between
500 and 600. I have had about two letters a week
for the past five years and have kept them all.
Father almost always tells me in his letters to read
my Bible and say my prayers and obey Grandmother
and stand up straight and turn out my toes and
brush my teeth and be good to my little sister. I
have been practising all these so long I can say, as
the young man did in the Bible when Jesus told him
what to do to be saved, &#8220;all these have I kept from
my youth up.&#8221; But then, I lack quite a number of
things after all. I am not always strictly obedient.
For instance, I know Grandmother never likes to
have us read the secular part of the <i>New York Observer</i>
on Sunday, so she puts it in the top drawer
of the sideboard until Monday, but I couldn&#8217;t find
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>anything interesting to read the other Sunday so I
took it out and read it and put it back. The jokes
and stories in it did not seem as amusing as usual
so I think I will not do it again.</p>

<p>Grandfather&#8217;s favorite paper is the <i>Boston Christian
Register.</i> He could not have one of them torn
up any more than a leaf of the Bible. He has barrels
of them stored away in the garret.</p>

<p>I asked Grandmother to-day to write a verse for
me to keep always and she wrote a good one: &#8220;To
be happy and live long the three grand essentials are:
Be busy, love somebody and have high aims.&#8221; I
think, from all I have noticed about her, that she
has had this for her motto all her life and I don&#8217;t
think Anna and I can do very much better than to
try and follow it too. Grandfather tells us sometimes,
when she is not in the room, that the best
thing we can do is to be just as near like Grandmother
as we can possibly be.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Saturday, May</i> 30.&mdash;Louisa Field came over to
dinner to-day and brought Allie with her. We had
roast chickens for dinner and lots of other nice
things. Grandmother taught us how to string lilac
blossoms for necklaces and also how to make curls
of dandelion stems. She always has some things in
the parlor cupboard which she brings out on extra
occasions, so she got them out to-day. They are
some Chinamen which Uncle Thomas brought home
when he sailed around the world. They are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>wooden images standing in boxes, packing tea with
their feet.</p>

<p>Last week Jennie Howell invited us to go up to
Black Point Cabin with her and to-day with a lot of
grown-up people we went and enjoyed it. There
was a little colored girl there who waits on the table
and can row the boats too. She is Polly Carroll&#8217;s
granddaughter, Mary Jane. She sang for us,</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<table summary='poetry' class='left2'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;Nellie Ely shuts her eye when she goes to sleep,</p>
<p>When she opens them again her eyes begin to peep;</p>
<p>Hi Nellie, Ho Nellie, listen love to me,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll sing for you, I&#8217;ll play for you,</p>
<p style='margin-left:2ex'>  A dulcet melody.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
</div>

<p>She is just as cute as she can be. She said Mrs.
Henry Chesebro taught her to read.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday, June</i> 1.&mdash;Rev. Dr. Shaw, of Rochester,
preached for Dr. Daggett to-day and his text was:
&#8220;Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst
again, but whosoever drinketh of the water that I
shall give him shall never thirst.&#8221; He said by this
water he meant the pleasures of this life, wealth and
fame and honor, of which the more we have the
more we want and are never satisfied, but if we
drink of the water that Christ can give us we will
have happiness here and forever. It was a very
good sermon and I love to hear him preach.
Grandmother never likes to start for church until
after all the Seminary girls and Academy boys have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>gone by, but this morning we got to the gate just
as the boys came along. When Grandmother saw
five or six hats come off and knew they were bowing
to us, she asked us how we got acquainted with
them. We told her that almost all the girls knew
the Academy boys and I am sure that is true.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Tuesday, June</i> 8.&mdash;We are cleaning house now
and Grandmother asked Anna and me to take out a
few tacks in the dining-room carpet. We did not
like it so very well but we liked eating dinner in
the parlor, as the table had to be set in there. Anna
told us that when she got married we could come to
visit her any time in the year as she was never going
to clean house. We went down street on an errand
to-night and hurried right back, as Grandmother
said she should look at the clock and see how long
we were gone. Emma Wheeler went with us.
Anna says she and Emma are as &#8220;thick as hasty
pudding.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>June.</i>&mdash;Rev. Frederick Starr, of Penn Yan, had
an exhibition in Bemis Hall to-day of a tabernacle
just like the children of Israel carried with them to
the Promised Land. We went to see it. He made
it himself and said he took all the directions from
the Bible and knew where to put the curtains and
the poles and everything. It was interesting but we
thought it would be queer not to have any church
to go to but one like that, that you could take down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>and put up and carry around with you wherever you
went.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>June.</i>&mdash;Rev. Mr. Kendall is not going to preach
in East Bloomfield any more. The paper says he
is going to New York to live and be Secretary of
the A.B.C.F.M. I asked Grandmother what that
meant, and she said he would have to write down
what the missionaries do. I guess that will keep
him busy. Grandfather&#8217;s nephew, a Mr. Adams of
Boston and his wife, visited us about two weeks ago.
He is the head of the firm Adams&#8217; Express Co.
Anna asked them if they ever heard the conundrum
&#8220;What was Eve made for?&#8221; and they said no, so
she told them the answer, &#8220;for Adam&#8217;s express company.&#8221;
They thought it was quite good. When
they reached home, they sent us each a reticule, with
scissors, thimble, stiletto, needle-case and tiny penknife
and some stamped embroidery. They must
be very rich.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Saturday Night, July.</i>&mdash;Grandfather was asking
us to-night how many things we could remember,
and I told him I could remember when Zachary Taylor
died, and our church was draped in black, and
Mr. Daggett preached a funeral sermon about him,
and I could remember when Daniel Webster died,
and there was service held in the church and his last
words, &#8220;I still live,&#8221; were put up over the pulpit.
He said he could remember when George Washington
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>died and when Benjamin Franklin died. He
was seven years old then and he was seventeen when
Washington died. Of course his memory goes farther
back than mine, but he said I did very well,
considering.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>July.</i>&mdash;I have not written in my journal for several
days because we have been out of town.
Grandfather had to go to Victor on business and
took Anna and me with him. Anna says she loves
to ride on the cars as it is fun to watch the trees
and fences run so. We took dinner at Dr. Ball&#8217;s
and came home on the evening train. Then Judge
Ellsworth came over from Penn Yan to see Grandfather
on business and asked if he could take us
home with him and he said yes, so we went and had
a splendid time and stayed two days. Stewart was
at home and took us all around driving and took us
to the graveyard to see our mother&#8217;s grave. I
copied this verse from the gravestone:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<table summary='poetry' class='left2'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;Of gentle seeming was her form</p>
<p>And the soft beaming of her radiant eye</p>
<p>Was sunlight to the beauty of her face.</p>
<p>Peace, sacred peace, was written on her brow</p>
<p>And flowed in the low music of her voice</p>
<p>Which came unto the list&#8217;ner like the tones of soothing Autumn winds.</p>
<p>Her hands were full of consolations which she scattered free to all&mdash;the poor, the sick, the sorrowful.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>I think she must have been exactly like Grandmother
only she was 32 and Grandmother is 72.</p>

<p>Stewart went to prayer meeting because it was
Wednesday night, and when he came home his
mother asked him if he took part in the meeting.
He said he did and she asked him what he said.
He said he told the story of Ethan Allen, the infidel,
who was dying, and his daughter asked him whose
religion she should live by, his or her mother&#8217;s, and
he said, &#8220;Your mother&#8217;s, my daughter, your mother&#8217;s.&#8221;
This pleased Mrs. Ellsworth very much.
Stewart is a great boy and you never can tell
whether he is in earnest or not. It was very warm
while we were gone and when we got home Anna
told Grandmother she was going to put on her
barège dress and take a rocking-chair and a glass of
ice water and a palm leaf fan and go down cellar
and sit, but Grandmother told her if she would just
sit still and take a book and get her mind on something
else besides the weather, she would be cool
enough. Grandmother always looks as cool as a
cucumber even when the thermometer is 90 in the
shade.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday, August.</i>&mdash;Rev. Anson D. Eddy preached
this morning. His text was from the sixth chapter
of John, 44th verse. &#8220;No man can come to me,
except the Father which hath sent me, draw him.&#8221;
He is Tom Eddy&#8217;s father, and very good-looking
and smart too. He used to be one of the ministers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>of our church before Mr. Daggett came. He wrote
a book in our Sunday School library, about Old
Black Jacob, and Grandmother loves to read it.
We had a nice dinner to-day, green peas, lemonade
and gooseberry pie. We had cold roast lamb too,
because Grandmother never has any meat cooked on
Sunday.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;Mr. Noah T. Clarke is superintendent
of our Sunday School now, and this morning he
asked, &#8220;What is prayer?&#8221; No one answered, so I
stood up and gave the definition from the catechism.
He seemed pleased and so was Grandmother when
I told her. Anna said she supposes she was glad
that &#8220;her labor was not in vain in the Lord.&#8221; I
think she is trying to see if she can say Bible verses,
like grown-up people do.</p>

<p>Grandfather said that I did better than the little
boy he read about who, when a visitor asked the
Sunday School children what was the ostensible
object of Sabbath School instruction, waited till the
question was repeated three times and then stood up
and said, &#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;We could not go to prayer meeting
to-night because it rained, so Grandmother said we
could go into the kitchen and stand by the window
and hear the Methodists. We could hear every
word that old Father Thompson said, and every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>hymn they sung, but Mr. Jervis used such big words
we could not understand him at all.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;Grandmother says she loves to look at
the beautiful white heads of Mr. Francis Granger
and General Granger as they sit in their pews in
church. She says that is what it means in the
twelfth chapter of Ecclesiastes where it says, &#8220;And
the almond tree shall flourish.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know exactly
why it means them, but I suppose she does.
We have got a beautiful almond tree in our front
yard covered with flowers, but the blossoms are pink.
Probably they had white ones in Jerusalem, where
Solomon lived.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Mr. Alex. Jeffrey has come from
Lexington, Ky., and brought Mrs. Ross and his
three daughters, Julia, Shaddie and Bessie Jeffrey.
Mrs. Ross knows Grandmother and came to call
and brought the girls. They are very pretty and
General Granger&#8217;s granddaughters. I think they
are going to stay all summer.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Thanksgiving Day.</i>&mdash;We all went to church and
Dr. Daggett&#8217;s text was: &#8220;He hath not dealt so
with any nation.&#8221; Aunt Glorianna and her children
were here and Uncle Field and all their family and
Dr. Carr and all his family. There were about sixteen
of us in all and we children had a table in the
corner all by ourselves. We had roast turkey and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>everything else we could think of. After dinner
we went into the parlor and Aunt Glorianna played
on the piano and sang, &#8220;Flow gently, sweet Afton,
among thy green braes,&#8221; and &#8220;Poor Bessie was a
sailor&#8217;s wife.&#8221; These are Grandfather&#8217;s favorites.
Dr. Carr sang &#8220;I&#8217;m sitting on the stile, Mary, where
we sat side by side.&#8221; He is a beautiful singer. It
seemed just like Sunday, for Grandmother never
likes to have us work or play on Thanksgiving Day,
but we had a very good time, indeed, and were sorry
when they all went home.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Saturday, December</i> 20.&mdash;Lillie Reeve and her
brother, Charlie, have come from Texas to live.
He goes to the Academy and she boards with Miss
Antoinette Pierson. Miss Pierson invited me up to
spend the afternoon and take tea with her and I
went and had a very nice time. She told me about
their camp life in Texas and how her mother died,
and her little baby sister, Minnie, lives with her
Grandmother Sheppard in Dansville. She is a very
nice girl and I like her very much, indeed.</p>

</div>

<p><i>January</i> 8.&mdash;Anna and Alice Jewett caught a ride
down to the lake this afternoon on a bob-sleigh, and
then caught a ride back on a load of frozen pigs.
In jumping off, Anna tore her flannel petticoat from
the band down. I did not enjoy the situation as
much as Anna, because I had to sit up after she
had gone to bed, and darn it by candle light, because
she was afraid Grandmother might see the rent and
inquire into it, and that would put an end to bobsled
exploits.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>March</i> 6.&mdash;Anna and her set will have to square
accounts with Mr. Richards to-morrow, for nine of
them ran away from school this afternoon, Alice
Jewett, Louisa Field, Sarah Antes, Hattie Paddock,
Helen Coy, Jennie Ruckel, Frankie Younglove,
Emma Wheeler and Anna. They went out to Mr.
Sackett&#8217;s, where they are making maple sugar. Mr.
and Mrs. Sackett were at home and two Miss Sacketts
and Darius, and they asked them in and gave
them all the sugar they wanted, and Anna said
pickles, too, and bread and butter, and the more
pickles they ate the more sugar they could eat. I
guess they will think of pickles when Mr. Richards
asks them where they were. I think Ellie Daggett
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>and Charlie Paddock went, too, and some of the
Academy boys.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>March 7.</i>&mdash;They all had to stay after school to-night
for an hour and copy Dictionary. Anna
seems reconciled, for she just wrote in her journal:
&#8220;It was a very good plan to keep us because no one
ever ought to stay out of school except on account
of sickness, and if they once get a thing fixed in
their minds it will stay there, and when they grow
up it will do them a great deal of good.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>April.</i>&mdash;Grandfather gave us 10 cents each this
morning for learning the 46th Psalm and has promised
us $1 each for reading the Bible through in a
year. We were going to any way. Some of the
girls say they should think we would be afraid of
Grandfather, he is so sober, but we are not the least
bit. He let us count $1,000 to-night which a Mr.
Taylor, a cattle buyer, brought to him in the evening
after banking hours. Anybody must be very rich
who has all that money of their own.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Our old horse is dead and we will have
to buy another. He was very steady and faithful.
One day Grandfather left him at the front gate and
he started along and turned the corner all right,
down the Methodist lane and went way down to our
barn doors and stood there until Mr. Piser came
and took him into the barn. People said they set
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>their clocks by him because it was always quarter
past 12 when he was driven down to the bank after
Grandfather and quarter of 1 when he came back.
I don&#8217;t think the clocks would ever be too fast if
they were set by him. We asked Grandfather what
he died of and he said he had run his race but I
think he meant he had walked it, for I never saw
him go off a jog in my life. Anna used to say he
was taking a nap when we were out driving with
Grandfather. I have written some lines in his memory
and if I knew where he was buried, I would
print it on his head board.</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<table summary='poetry' class='left2'><tr><td>
<p>Old Dobbin&#8217;s dead, that good old horse,</p>
<p style='margin-left:2ex'>  We ne&#8217;er shall see him more,</p>
<p>He always used to lag behind</p>
<p style='margin-left:2ex'>  But now he&#8217;s gone before.</p>
</td></tr></table>
</div>

<p>It is a parody on old Grimes is dead, which is in
our reader, only that is a very long poem. I am
not going to show mine to Grandfather till he gets
over feeling bad about the horse.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;Grandmother gave Anna, Doddridge&#8217;s
&#8220;Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul&#8221; to
read to-day. Anna says she thinks she will have
to rise and progress a good deal before she will be
able to appreciate it. Baxter&#8217;s &#8220;Saints Rest&#8221;
would probably suit her better.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span><i>Sunday, April</i> 5.&mdash;An agent for the American
Board of Foreign Missions preached this morning
in our church from Romans 10: 15: &#8220;How shall
they hear without a preacher and how shall they
preach except they be sent.&#8221; An agent from every
society presents the cause, whatever it is, once a
year and some people think the anniversary comes
around very often. I always think of Mrs. George
Wilson&#8217;s poem on &#8220;A apele for air, pewer air, certin
proper for the pews, which, she sez, is scarce as
piety, or bank bills when ajents beg for mischuns,
wich sum say is purty often, (taint nothin&#8217; to me,
wat I give aint nothin&#8217; to nobody).&#8221; I think that
is about the best poem of its kind I ever read.</p>

<p>Miss Lizzie Bull told us in Sunday School to-day
that she cannot be our Sunday School teacher any
more, as she and her sister Mary are going to join
the Episcopal Church. We hate to have her go,
but what can&#8217;t be cured must be endured. Part of
our class are going into Miss Mary Howell&#8217;s class
and part into Miss Annie Pierce&#8217;s. They are both
splendid teachers and Miss Lizzie Bull is another.
We had preaching in our church this afternoon, too.
Rev. Samuel Hanson Cox, of Le Roy Female Seminary,
preached. He is a great man, very large, long
white hair combed back. I think if a person once
saw him they would never forget him. He preached
about Melchisidek, who had neither &#8220;beginning of
days or end of life.&#8221; Some people thought that
was like his sermon, for it was more than one hour
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>long. Dr. Cox and Mrs. Taylor came to call and
asked Grandfather to let me go to Le Roy Female
Seminary, but Grandfather likes Ontario Female
Seminary better than any other in the world. We
wanted Grandmother to have her picture taken, but
she did not feel able to go to Mr. Finley&#8217;s, so he
came up Tuesday and took it in our dining-room.
She had her best cap on and her black silk dress and
sat in her high back rocking chair in her usual corner
near the window. He brought one up to show
us and we like it so much. Anna looked at it and
kissed it and said, &#8220;Grandmother, I think you are
perfectly beautiful.&#8221; She smiled and very modestly
put her handkerchief up to her face and said, &#8220;You
foolish child,&#8221; but I am sure she was pleased, for
how could she help it? A man came up to the open
window one day where she was sitting, with something
to sell, and while she was talking to him he
said, &#8220;You must have been handsome, lady, when
you were young.&#8221; Grandmother said it was because
he wanted to sell his wares, but we thought
he knew it was so. We told her she couldn&#8217;t get
around it that way and we asked Grandfather and
he said it was true. Our Sunday School class went
to Mr. Finley&#8217;s to-day and had a group ambrotype
taken for our teacher, Miss Annie Pierce; Susie
Daggett, Clara Willson, Sarah Whitney, Mary Field
and myself. Mary Wheeler ought to have been in
it, too, but we couldn&#8217;t get her to come. We had
very good success.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;We gave the ambrotype to Miss
Pierce and she liked it very much and so does her
mother and Fannie. Her mother is lame and cannot
go anywhere so we often go to see her and she
is always glad to see us and so pleasant.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>May</i> 9.&mdash;Miss Lizzie Bull came for me to go botanising
with her this morning and we were gone
from 9 till 12, and went clear up to the orphan asylum.
I am afraid I am not a born botanist, for all
the time she was analysing the flowers and telling
me about the corona and the corolla and the calyx
and the stamens and petals and pistils, I was thinking
what beautiful hands she had and how dainty
they looked, pulling the blossoms all to pieces. I
am afraid I am commonplace, like the man we read
of in English literature, who said &#8220;a primrose by
the river brim, a yellow primrose, was to him, and
it was nothing more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. William Wood came to call this afternoon
and gave us some morning-glory seeds to sow and
told us to write down in our journals that he did so.
So here it is. What a funny old man he is. Anna
and Emma Wheeler went to Hiram Tousley&#8217;s
funeral to-day. She has just written in her journal
that Hiram&#8217;s corpse was very perfect of him and
that Fannie looked very pretty in black. She also
added that after the funeral Grandfather took Aunt
Ann and Lucilla out to ride to Mr. Howe&#8217;s and just
as they got there it sprinkled. She says she don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>know &#8220;weather&#8221; they got wet or not. She went
to a picnic at Sucker Brook yesterday afternoon,
and this is the way she described it in her journal.
&#8220;Miss Hurlburt told us all to wear rubbers and
shawls and bring some cake and we would have a
picnic. We had a very warm time. It was very
warm indeed and I was most roasted and we were
all very thirsty indeed. We had in all the party
about 40 of us. It was very pleasant and I enjoyed
myself exceedingly. We had boiled eggs, pickles,
Dutch cheese and sage cheese and loaf cake and
raisin cake, pound cake, dried beef and capers, jam
and tea cakes and gingerbread, and we tried to catch
some fish but we couldn&#8217;t, and in all we had a very
nice time. I forgot to say that I picked some flowers
for my teacher. I went to bed tired out and
worn out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her next entry was the following day when she
and the other scholars dressed up to &#8220;speak pieces.&#8221;
She says, &#8220;After dinner I went and put on my rope
petticoat and lace one over it and my barège de laine
dress and all my rings and white bask and breastpin
and worked handkerchief and spoke my piece. It
was, &#8216;When I look up to yonder sky.&#8217; It is very
pretty indeed and most all the girls said I looked
nice and said it nice. They were all dressed up,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;I asked Grandfather why we do not
have gas in the house like almost every one else
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>and he said because it was bad for the eyes and he
liked candles and sperm oil better. We have the
funniest little sperm oil lamp with a shade on to read
by evenings and the fire on the hearth gives Grandfather
and Grandmother all the light they want, for
she knits in her corner and we read aloud to them
if they want us to. I think if Grandfather is proud
of anything besides being a Bostonian, it is that
everything in the house is forty years old. The
shovel and tongs and andirons and fender and the
haircloth sofa and the haircloth rocking chair and
the flag bottomed chairs painted dark green and the
two old arm-chairs which belong to them and no one
else ever thinks of touching. There is a wooden partition
between the dining-room and parlor and they
say it can slide right up out of sight on pulleys, so
that it would be all one room. We have often said
that we wished we could see it go up but they say
it has never been up since the day our mother was
married and as she is dead I suppose it would make
them feel bad, so we probably will always have it
down. There are no curtains or even shades at the
windows, because Grandfather says, &#8220;light is sweet
and a pleasant thing it is to behold the sun.&#8221; The
piano is in the parlor and it is the same one that our
mother had when she was a little girl but we like it
all the better for that. There are four large oil
paintings on the parlor wall, De Witt Clinton, Rev.
Mr. Dwight, Uncle Henry Channing Beals and Aunt
Lucilla Bates, and no matter where we sit in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>room they are watching and their eyes seem to move
whenever we do. There is quite a handsome lamp
on a mahogany center table, but I never saw it
lighted. We have four sperm candles in four silver
candlesticks and when we have company we light
them. Johnnie Thompson, son of the minister,
Rev. M. L. R. P., has come to the academy to school
and he is very full of fun and got acquainted with
all the girls very quick. He told us this afternoon
to have &#8220;the other candle lit&#8221; for he was coming
down to see us this evening. Will Schley heard him
say it and he said he was coming too. His mother
says she always knows when he has been at our
house, because she finds sperm on his clothes and has
to take brown paper and a hot flatiron to get it out,
but still I do not think that Mrs. Schley cares, for
she is a very nice lady and she and I are great
friends. I presume she would just as soon he
would spend part of his time with us as to be with
Horace Finley all the time. Those boys are just
like twins. We never see one without being sure
that the other is not far away.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Later</i>.&mdash;The boys came and we had a very
pleasant evening but when the 9 o&#8217;clock bell rang we
heard Grandfather winding up the clock and scraping
up the ashes on the hearth to cover the fire so it
would last till morning and we all understood the
signal and they bade us good-night. &#8220;We won&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>go home till morning&#8221; is a song that will never be
sung in this house.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>June</i> 2.&mdash;Abbie Clark wrote such a nice piece in
my album to-day I am going to write it in my journal.
Grandfather says he likes the sentiment as
well as any in my book. This is it: &#8220;It has been
said that the friendship of some people is like our
shadow, keeping close by us while the sun shines,
deserting us the moment we enter the shade, but
think not such is the friendship of Abbie S. Clark.&#8221;
Abbie and I took supper at Miss Mary Howell&#8217;s to-night
to see Adele Ives. We had a lovely time.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;General Tom Thumb was in town to-day
and everybody who wanted to see him could go
to Bemis Hall. Twenty-five cents for old people,
and 10 cents for children, but we could see him for
nothing when he drove around town. He had a
little carriage and two little bits of ponies and a little
boy with a high silk hat on, for the driver. He sat
inside the coach but we could see him looking out.
We went to the hall in the afternoon and the man
who brought him stood by him and looked like a
giant and told us all about him. Then he asked
Tom Thumb to make a speech and stood him upon
the table. He told all the ladies he would give
them a kiss if they would come up and buy his picture.
Some of them did.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span><i>Friday, July.</i>&mdash;I have not kept a journal for two
weeks because we have been away visiting. Anna
and I had an invitation to go to Utica to visit Rev.
and Mrs. Brandigee. He is rector of Grace Episcopal
church there and his wife used to belong to
Father&#8217;s church in Morristown, N. J. Her name
was Miss Condict. Rev. Mr. Stowe was going to
Hamilton College at Clinton, so he said he would
take us to Utica. We had a lovely time. The corner
stone of the church was laid while we were there
and Bishop De Lancey came and stayed with us at
Mr. Brandigee&#8217;s. He is a very nice man and likes
children. One morning they had muffins for breakfast
and Anna asked if they were ragamuffins. Mr.
Brandigee said, &#8220;Yes, they are made of rags and
brown paper,&#8221; but we knew he was just joking.
When we came away Mrs. Brandigee gave me a
prayer book and Anna a vase, but she didn&#8217;t like it
and said she should tell Mrs. Brandigee she wanted
a prayer book too, so I had to change with her.
When we came home Mr. Brandigee put us in care
of the conductor. There was a fine soldier looking
man in the car with us and we thought it was his
wife with him. He wore a blue coat and brass buttons,
and some one said his name was Custer and
that he was a West Point cadet and belonged to the
regular army. I told Anna she had better behave
or he would see her, but she would go out and
stand on the platform until the conductor told her
not to. I pulled her dress and looked very stern at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>her and motioned toward Mr. Custer, but it did not
seem to have any impression on her. I saw Mr.
Custer smile once because my words had no effect.
I was glad when we got to Canandaigua. I heard
some one say that Dr. Jewett was at the depôt to
take Mr. Custer and his wife to his house, but I only
saw Grandfather coming after us. He said, &#8220;Well,
girls, you have been and you have got back,&#8221; but I
could see that he was glad to have us at home again,
even if we are &#8220;troublesome comforts,&#8221; as he sometimes
says.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>July</i> 4.&mdash;Barnum&#8217;s circus was in town to-day and
if Grandmother had not seen the pictures on the
hand bills I think she would have let us go. She
said it was all right to look at the creatures God had
made but she did not think He ever intended that
women should go only half dressed and stand up and
ride on horses bare back, or jump through hoops in
the air. So we could not go. We saw the street
parade though and heard the band play and saw the
men and women in a chariot, all dressed so fine, and
we saw a big elephant and a little one and a camel
with an awful hump on his back, and we could hear
the lion roar in the cage, as they went by. It must
have been nice to see them close to and probably we
will some day.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span><i>August</i> 8.&mdash;Grandfather has given me his whole
set of Waverley novels and his whole set of Shakespeare&#8217;s
plays, and has ordered Mr. Jahn, the cabinetmaker,
to make me a black walnut bookcase, with
glass doors and three deep drawers underneath,
with brass handles. He is so good. Anna says
perhaps he thinks I am going to be married and go
to housekeeping some day. Well, perhaps he does.
Stranger things have happened. &#8220;Barkis is willin&#8217;,&#8221;
and I always like to please Grandfather. I
have just read David Copperfield and was so interested
I could not leave it alone till I finished it.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>September</i> 1.&mdash;Anna and I have been in Litchfield,
Conn., at Father&#8217;s school for boys. It is kept
in the old Beecher house, where Dr. Lyman Beecher
lived. We went up into the attic, which is light and
airy, where they say he used to write his famous sermons.
James is one of the teachers and he came
for us. We went to Farmington and saw all the
Cowles families, as they are our cousins. Then we
drove by the Charter Oak and saw all there is left
of it. It was blown down last year but the stump
is fenced around. In Hartford we visited Gallaudet&#8217;s
Institution for the deaf and dumb and went to
the historical rooms, where we saw some of George
Washington&#8217;s clothes and his watch and his penknife,
but we did not see his little hatchet. We
stayed two weeks in New York and vicinity before
we came home. Uncle Edward took us to Christie&#8217;s
Minstrels and the Hippodrome, so we saw all the
things we missed seeing when the circus was here in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>town. Grandmother seemed surprised when we
told her, but she didn&#8217;t say much because she was so
glad to have us at home again. Anna said we ought
to bring a present to Grandfather and Grandmother,
for she read one time about some children who went
away and came back grown up and brought home
&#8220;busts of the old philosophers for the sitting-room,&#8221;
so as we saw some busts of George Washington and
Benjamin Franklin in plaster of paris we bought
them, for they look almost like marble and Grandfather
and Grandmother like them. Speaking of
busts reminds me of a conundrum I heard while I
was gone. &#8220;How do we know that Poe&#8217;s Raven
was a dissipated bird? Because he was all night on
a bust.&#8221; Grandfather took us down to the bank to
see how he had it made over while we were gone.
We asked him why he had a beehive hanging out for
a sign and he said, &#8220;Bees store their honey in the
summer for winter use and men ought to store their
money against a rainy day.&#8221; He has a swing door
to the bank with &#8220;Push&#8221; on it. He said he saw a
man studying it one day and finally looking up he
spelled p-u-s-h, push (and pronounced it like mush).
&#8220;What does that mean?&#8221; Grandfather showed
him what it meant and he thought it was very convenient.
He was about as thick-headed as the man
who saw some snuffers and asked what they were
for and when told to snuff the candle with, he immediately
snuffed the candle with his fingers and put it
in the snuffers and said, &#8220;Law sakes, how handy!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>Grandmother really laughed when she read this in
the paper.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>September</i>.&mdash;Mrs. Martin, of Albany, is visiting
Aunt Ann, and she brought Grandmother a fine fish
that was caught in the Atlantic Ocean. We went
over and asked her to come to dinner to-morrow and
help eat it and she said if it did not rain pitchforks
she would come, so I think we may expect her. Her
granddaughter, Hattie Blanchard, has come here to
go to the seminary and will live with Aunt Ann.
She is a very pretty girl. Mary Field came over
this morning and we went down street together.
Grandfather went with us to Mr. Nat Gorham&#8217;s
store, as he is selling off at cost, and got Grandmother
and me each a new pair of kid gloves. Hers
are black and mine are green. Hers cost six shillings
and mine cost five shillings and six pence; very
cheap for such nice ones. Grandmother let Anna
have six little girls here to supper to-night: Louisa
Field, Hattie Paddock, Helen Coy, Martha Densmore,
Emma Wheeler and Alice Jewett. We had a
splendid supper and then we played cards. I do not
mean regular cards, mercy no! Grandfather thinks
those kind are contagious or outrageous or something
dreadful and never keeps them in the house.
Grandmother said they found a pack once, when the
hired man&#8217;s room was cleaned, and they went into
the fire pretty quick. The kind we played was
just &#8220;Dr. Busby,&#8221; and another &#8220;The Old Soldier
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>and His Dog.&#8221; There are counters with them, and
if you don&#8217;t have the card called for you have to
pay one into the pool. It is real fun. They all said
they had a very nice time, indeed, when they bade
Grandmother good-night, and said: &#8220;Mrs. Beals,
you must let Carrie and Anna come and see us some
time,&#8221; and she said she would. I think it is nice to
have company.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Christmas</i>.&mdash;Grandfather and Grandmother do
not care much about making Christmas presents.
They say, when they were young no one observed
Christmas or New Years, but they always kept
Thanksgiving day. Our cousins, the Fields and
Carrs, gave us several presents and Uncle Edward
sent us a basket full from New York by express.
Aunt Ann gave me one of the Lucy books and a
Franconia story book and to Anna, &#8220;The Child&#8217;s
Book on Repentance.&#8221; When Anna saw the title,
she whispered to me and said if she had done anything
she was sorry for she was willing to be forgiven.
I am afraid she will never read hers but I
will lend her mine. Miss Lucy Ellen Guernsey, of
Rochester, gave me &#8220;Christmas Earnings&#8221; and
wrote in it, &#8220;Carrie C. Richards with the love of
the author.&#8221; I think that is very nice. Anna and
I were chattering like two magpies to-day, and a
man came in to talk to Grandfather on business.
He told us in an undertone that children should be
seen and not heard. After he had gone I saw Anna
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>watching him a long time till he was only a speck in
the distance and I asked her what she was doing.
She said she was doing it because it was a sign if
you watched persons out of sight you would never
see them again. She does not seem to have a very
forgiving spirit, but you can&#8217;t always tell.</p>

<p>Mr. William Wood, the venerable philanthropist
of whom Canandaigua has been justly proud for
many years, is dead. I have preserved this poem,
written by Mrs. George Willson in his honor:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<span class='sc'>Mr. Editor</span>&mdash;The following lines were written by
a lady of this village, and have been heretofore published,
but on reading in your last paper the interesting
extract relating to the late William Wood, Esq.,
it was suggested that they be again published, not
only for their merit, but also to keep alive the memory
of one who has done so much to ornament our village.</p>

<p><i>February</i> 24, 1858.&mdash;The boarders at the Seminary
had some tableaux last evening and invited a
great many from the village. As we went in with
the crowd, we heard some one say, &#8220;Are they going
to have tableaux? Well, I thought I smelt them!&#8221;
They were splendid. Mr. Chubbuck was in nearly
all of them. The most beautiful one was Abraham
offering up Isaac. Mr. Chubbuck was Abraham
and Sarah Ripley was Isaac. After the tableaux
they acted a charade. The word was &#8220;Masterpiece.&#8221;
It was fine. After the audience got half
way out of the chapel Mr. Richards announced
&#8220;The Belle of the Evening.&#8221; The curtain rose and
every one rushed back, expecting to see a young lady
dressed in the height of fashion, when immediately
the Seminary bell rang! Mr. Blessner&#8217;s scholars
gave all the music and he stamped so, beating time,
it almost drowned the music. Some one suggested
a bread and milk poultice for his foot. Anna has
been taking part in some private theatricals. The
play is in contrast to &#8220;The Spirit of &#8217;76&#8221; and the
idea carried out is that the men should stay at home
and rock the cradles and the women should take the
rostrum. Grandmother was rather opposed to the
idea, but every one wanted Anna to take the part of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>leading lady, so she consented. She even helped
Anna make her bloomer suit and sewed on the braid
for trimming on the skirt herself. She did not
know that Anna&#8217;s opening sentence was, &#8220;How are
you, sir? Cigar, please!&#8221; It was acted at Mrs.
John Bates&#8217; house on Gibson Street and was a great
success, but when they decided to repeat it another
evening Grandmother told Anna she must choose between
going on the stage and living with her Grandmother,
so Anna gave it up and some one else took
her part.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>March</i>.&mdash;There is a great deal said about spirits
nowadays and a lot of us girls went into one of the
recitation rooms after school to-night and had a
spiritual seance. We sat around Mr. Chubbuck&#8217;s
table and put our hands on it and it moved around
and stood on two legs and sometimes on one. I
thought the girls helped it but they said they didn&#8217;t.
We heard some loud raps, too, but they sounded
very earthly to me. Eliza Burns, one of the boarders,
told us if we would hold our breath we could
pick up one of the girls from the floor and raise her
up over our heads with one finger of each hand, if
the girl held her breath, too. We tried it with
Anna and did it, but we had such hard work to keep
from laughing I expected we would drop her.
There is nothing very spirituelle about any of us.
I told Grandmother and she said we reminded her of
Jemima Wilkinson, who told all her followers that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>the world was to come to an end on a certain day
and they should all be dressed in white and get up
on the roofs of the houses and be prepared to ascend
and meet the Lord in the air. I asked Grandmother
what she said when nothing happened and she said
she told them it was because they did not have faith
enough. If they had, everything would have happened
just as she said. Grandmother says that one
day at a time has always been enough for her and
that to-morrow will take care of the things of itself.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>May,</i> 1858.&mdash;Several of us girls went up into the
top of the new Court House to-day as far as the
workmen would allow us. We got a splendid view
of the lake and of all the country round. Abbie
Clark climbed up on a beam and recited part of
Alexander Selkirk&#8217;s soliloquy:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<table summary='poetry' class='left2'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m monarch of all I survey,</p>
<p>My rights there are none to dispute:</p>
<p>From the center, all round to the sea,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m lord of the fowl and brute.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
</div>

<p>I was standing on a block and she said I looked
like &#8220;Patience on a monument smiling at Grief.&#8221; I
am sure she could not be taken for &#8220;Grief.&#8221; She
always has some quotation on her tongue&#8217;s end.
We were down at Sucker Brook the other day and
she picked her way out to a big stone in the middle
of the stream and, standing on it, said, in the words
of Rhoderick Dhu,</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<table summary='poetry' class='left2'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;Come one, come all, this rock shall fly</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>From its firm base, as soon as I.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
</div>

<p>Just then the big stone tipped over and she had
to wade ashore. She is not at all afraid of climbing
and as we left the Court House she said she would
like to go outside on the cupola and help Justice balance
the scales.</p>

<p>A funny old man came to our house to-day as he
wanted to deposit some money and reached the bank
after it was closed. We were just sitting down to
dinner so Grandfather asked him to stay and have
&#8220;pot luck&#8221; with us. He said that he was very
much &#8220;obleeged&#8221; and stayed and passed his plate
a second time for more of our very fine &#8220;pot luck.&#8221;
We had boiled beef and dumplings and I suppose he
thought that was the name of the dish. He talked
so queer we couldn&#8217;t help noticing it. He said he
&#8220;heered&#8221; so and he was &#8220;afeered&#8221; and somebody
was very &#8220;deef&#8221; and they &#8220;hadn&#8217;t ought to have
done it&#8221; and &#8220;they should have went&#8221; and such
things. Anna and I almost laughed but Grandmother
looked at us with her eye and forefinger so
we sobered down. She told us afterwards that
there are many good people in the world whose
verbs and nouns do not agree, and instead of laughing
at them we should be sure that we always speak
correctly ourselves. Very true. Dr. Daggett was
at the Seminary one day when we had public exercises
and he told me afterwards that I said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>&#8220;sagac-ious&#8221; for &#8220;saga-cious&#8221; and Aunt Ann told
me that I said &#8220;epi-tome&#8221; for &#8220;e-pit-o-me.&#8221; So
&#8220;people that live in glass houses shouldn&#8217;t throw
stones.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;Grandfather read his favorite parable
this morning at prayers&mdash;the one about the wise man
who built his house upon a rock and the foolish man
who built upon the sand. He reads it good, just
like a minister. He prays good, too, and I know
his prayer by heart. He says, &#8220;Verily Thou art
our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of us and
Israel acknowledge us not,&#8221; and he always says,
&#8220;Thine arm is not shortened that it cannot save,
or Thine ear heavy that it cannot hear.&#8221; I am glad
that I can remember it.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>June.</i>&mdash;Cyrus W. Field called at our house to-day.
He is making a trip through the States and
stopped here a few hours because Grandmother is
his aunt. He made her a present of a piece of the
Atlantic cable about six inches long, which he had
mounted for her. It is a very nice souvenir. He
is a tall, fine looking man and very pleasant.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday, July</i> 4, 1858.&mdash;This is Communion Sunday
and quite a number united with the church
on profession of their faith. Mr. Gideon Granger
was one of them. Grandmother says that she has
known him always and his father and mother, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>she thinks he is like John, the beloved disciple. I
think that any one who knows him, knows what is
meant by a gentle-man. I have a picture of Christ
in the Temple with the doctors, and His face is
almost exactly like Mr. Granger&#8217;s. Some others
who joined to-day were Miss Belle Paton, Miss Lottie
Clark and Clara Willson, Mary Wheeler and
Sarah Andrews. Dr. Daggett always asks all the
communicants to sit in the body pews and the noncommunicants
in the side pews. We always feel
like the goats on the left when we leave Grandfather
and Grandmother and go on the side, but we won&#8217;t
have to always. Abbie Clark, Mary Field and I
think we will join at the communion in September.
Grandmother says she hopes we realize what a solemn
thing it is. We are fifteen years old so I think
we ought to. No one who hears Dr. Daggett say
in his beautiful voice, &#8220;I now renounce all ways of
sin as what I truly abhor and choose the service of
God as my greatest privilege,&#8221; could think it any
trifling matter. I feel as though I couldn&#8217;t be bad
if I wanted to be, and when he blesses them and
says, &#8220;May the God of the Everlasting Covenant
keep you firm and holy to the end through Jesus
Christ our Lord,&#8221; everything seems complete. He
always says at the close, &#8220;And when they had sung
an hymn they went out into the Mount of Olives.&#8221;
Then he gives out the hymn, beginning:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<table summary='poetry' class='left2'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;According to Thy gracious word,</p>
<p style='margin-left:2ex'>  In deep humility,</p>

<p>And the last verse:</p>

<div class='poetry'>

Taylor and Deacon Tyler sit on one side of Dr.
Daggett and Deacon Clarke and Deacon Castle on
the other. Grandfather and Grandmother joined
the church fifty-one years ago and are the oldest
living members. She says they have always been
glad that they took this step when they were young.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>August</i> 17.&mdash;There was a celebration in town
to-day because the Queen&#8217;s message was received on
the Atlantic cable. Guns were fired and church
bells rung and flags were waving everywhere. In
the evening there was a torchlight procession and the
town was all lighted up except Gibson Street. Allie
Antes died this morning, so the people on that street
kept their houses as usual. Anna says that probably
Allie Antes was better prepared to die than any
other little girl in town. Atwater hall and the
academy and the hotel were more brilliantly illuminated
than any other buildings. Grandfather saw
something in a Boston paper that a minister said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>in his sermon about the Atlantic cable and he
wants me to write it down in my journal. This is
it: &#8220;The two hemispheres are now successfully
united by means of the electric wire, but what is it,
after all, compared with the instantaneous communication
between the Throne of Divine Grace and the
heart of man? Offer up your silent petition. It is
transmitted through realms of unmeasured space
more rapidly than the lightning&#8217;s flash, and the
answer reaches the soul e&#8217;re the prayer has died
away on the sinner&#8217;s lips. Yet this telegraph, performing
its saving functions ever since Christ died
for men on Calvary, fills not the world with exultation
and shouts of gladness, with illuminations and
bonfires and the booming of cannon. The reason
is, one is the telegraph of this world and may produce
revolutions on earth; the other is the sweet
communication between Christ and the Christian
soul and will secure a glorious immortality in
Heaven.&#8221; Grandfather appreciates anything like
that and I like to please him.</p>

<p>Grandfather says he thinks the 19th Psalm is a
prophecy of the electric telegraph. &#8220;Their line
is gone out through all the earth and their words to
the end of the world.&#8221; It certainly sounds like it.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday</i>.&mdash;Rev. Henry Ward Beecher is staying
at Judge Taylor&#8217;s and came with them to church
to-day. Everybody knew that he was here and
thought he would preach and the church was packed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>full. When he came in he went right to Judge
Taylor&#8217;s pew and sat with him and did not preach
at all, but it was something to look at him. Mr.
Daggett was away on his vacation and Rev. Mr.
Jervis of the M. E. church preached. I heard some
people say they guessed even Mr. Beecher heard
some new words to-day, for Mr. Jervis is quite a
hand to make them up or find very long hard ones
in the dictionary.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>August</i> 30, 1858.&mdash;Rev. Mr. Tousley was hurt
to-day by the falling of his barn which was being
moved, and they think his back is broken and if he
lives he can never sit up again. Only last Sunday
he was in Sunday School and had us sing in memory
of Allie Antes:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<table summary='poetry' class='left2'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;A mourning class, a vacant seat,</p>
<p>Tell us that one we loved to meet</p>
<p>Will join our youthful throng no more,</p>
<p>&#8217;Till all these changing scenes are o&#8217;er.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
</div>

<p>And now he will never meet with us again and the
children will never have another minister all their
own. He thinks he may be able to write letters to
the children and perhaps write his own life. We all
hope he may be able to sit up if he cannot walk.</p>

<p>We went to our old home in Penn Yan visiting
last week and stayed at Judge Ellsworth&#8217;s. We
called to see the Tunnicliffs and the Olivers, Wells,
Jones, Shepards, Glovers, Bennetts, Judds and several
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>other families. They were glad to see us for
the sake of our father and mother. Father was
their pastor from 1841 to 1847.</p>

<p>Some one told us that when Bob and Henry
Antes were small boys they thought they would like
to try, just for once, to see how it would seem to
be bad, so in spite of all of Mr. Tousley&#8217;s sermons
they went out behind the barn one day and in a
whisper Bob said, &#8220;I swear,&#8221; and Henry said, &#8220;So
do I.&#8221; Then they came into the house looking
guilty and quite surprised, I suppose, that they
were not struck dead just as Ananias and Sapphira
were for lying.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>September</i>.&mdash;I read in a New York paper to-day
that Hon. George Peabody, of England, presented
Cyrus W. Field with a solid silver tea service of
twelve pieces, which cost $4,000. The pieces bear
likenesses of Mr. Peabody and Mr. Field, with the
coat of arms of the Field family. The epergne is
supported by a base representing the genius of
America.</p>

<p>We had experiments in the philosophy class to-day
and took electric shocks. Mr. Chubbuck managed
the battery which has two handles attached.
Two of the girls each held one of these and we all
took hold of hands making the circuit complete.
After a while it jerked us almost to pieces and we
asked Mr. Chubbuck to turn it off. Dana Luther,
one of the Academy boys, walked up from the post-office
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>with me this noon. He lives in Naples and
is Florence Younglove&#8217;s cousin. We went to a
ball game down on Pleasant Street after school. I
got so far ahead of Anna coming home she called
me her &#8220;distant relative.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>January</i>, 1859.&mdash;Mr. Woodruff came to see
Grandfather to ask him if we could attend his singing
school. He is going to have it one evening each
week in the chapel of our church. Quite a lot of
the boys and girls are going, so we were glad when
Grandfather gave his consent. Mr. Woodruff
wants us all to sing by note and teaches &#8220;do re me
fa sol la si do&#8221; from the blackboard and beats time
with a stick. He lets us have a recess, which is
more fun than all the rest of it. He says if we
practise well we can have a concert in Bemis Hall
to end up with. What a treat that will be!</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>February</i>.&mdash;Anna has been teasing me all the
morning about a verse which John Albert Granger
Barker wrote in my album. He has a most fascinating
lisp when he talks, so she says this is the
way the verse reads:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<table summary='poetry' class='left2'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;Beauty of perthon, ith thertainly chawming</p>
<p>Beauty of feachure, by no meanth alawming</p>
<p>But give me in pwefrence, beauty of mind,</p>
<p>Or give me Cawwie, with all thwee combined.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
</div>

<p>It takes Anna to find &#8220;amuthement&#8221; in &#8220;evewything.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>Mary Wheeler came over and pierced my ears
to-day, so I can wear my new earrings that Uncle
Edward sent me. She pinched my ear until it was
numb and then pulled a needle through, threaded
with silk. Anna would not stay in the room. She
wants hers done but does not dare. It is all the
fashion for girls to cut off their hair and friz it.
Anna and I have cut off ours and Bessie Seymour
got me to cut off her lovely long hair to-day. It
won&#8217;t be very comfortable for us to sleep with curl
papers all over our heads, but we must do it now.
I wanted my new dress waist which Miss Rosewarne
is making, to hook up in front, but Grandmother
said I would have to wear it that way all the rest
of my life so I had better be content to hook it in
the back a little longer. She said when Aunt Glorianna
was married, in 1848, it was the fashion for
grown up women to have their waists fastened in
the back, so the bride had hers made that way but
she thought it was a very foolish and inconvenient
fashion. It is nice, though, to dress in style and
look like other people. I have a Garibaldi waist and
a Zouave jacket and a balmoral skirt.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday</i>.&mdash;I asked Grandmother if I could write
a letter to Father to-day, and she said I could begin
it and tell him that I went to church and what Mr.
Daggett&#8217;s text was and then finish it to-morrow. I
did so, but I wish I could do it all after I began.
She said a verse from the Tract Primer:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<table summary='poetry' class='left2'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;A Sabbath well spent brings a week of content</p>
<p style='margin-left:2ex'>  And strength for the toil of to-morrow,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>But a Sabbath profaned, whatever be gained,</p>
<p style='margin-left:2ex'>  Is a certain forerunner of sorrow.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
</div>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Monday</i>.&mdash;We dressed up in new fangled costumes
to-day and wore them to school. Some of us
wore dresses almost up to our knees and some wore
them trailing on the ground. Some wore their hair
twisted in knots and some let theirs hang down
their backs. I wore my new waterfall for the first
time and Abbie Clark said I looked like &#8220;Hagar in
the Wilderness.&#8221; When she came in she looked
like a fashion plate, bedecked with bows and ribbons
and her hair up in a new way. When she came
in the door she stopped and said solemnly: &#8220;If
you have tears prepare to shed them now!&#8221; Laura
Chapin would not participate in the fun, for once.
She said she thought &#8220;Beauty unadorned was the
dorndest.&#8221; We did not have our lesson in mental
philosophy very well so we asked Mr. Richards to
explain the nature of dreams and their cause and
effect. He gave us a very interesting talk, which
occupied the whole hour. We listened with breathless
attention, so he must have marked us 100.</p>

<p>There was a lecture at the seminary to-night and
Rev. Dr. Hibbard, the Methodist minister, who lives
next door above the Methodist church, came home
with us. Grandmother was very much pleased
when we told her.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span><i>March</i> 1.&mdash;Our hired man has started a hot bed
and we went down behind the barn to see it.
Grandfather said he was up at 6 o&#8217;clock and walked
up as far as Mr. Greig&#8217;s lions and back again for
exercise before breakfast. He seems to have the
bloom of youth on his face as a reward. Anna says
she saw &#8220;Bloom of youth&#8221; advertised in the drug
store and she is going to buy some. I know Grandmother
won&#8217;t let her for it would be like &#8220;taking
coal to Newcastle.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>April.</i>&mdash;Anna wanted me to help her write a composition
last night, and we decided to write on &#8220;Old
Journals,&#8221; so we got hers and mine both out and
made selections and then she copied them. When
we were on our way to school this morning we met
Mr. E. M. Morse and Anna asked him if he did not
want to read her composition that Carrie wrote for
her. He made a very long face and pretended to
be much shocked, but said he would like to read
it, so he took it and also her album, which she asked
him to write in. At night, on his way home, he
stopped at our door and left them both. When she
looked in her album, she found this was what he
had written:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Anna, when you have grown old and wear spectacles
and a cap, remember the boyish young man who
saw your fine talents in 1859 and was certain you
would add culture to nature and become the pride of
Canandaigua. Do not forget also that no one deserves
praise for anything done by others and that your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>progress in wisdom and goodness will be watched by
no one more anxiously than by your true friend,</p>

<p style='text-align:right'><span class='sc'>E. M. Morse</span>.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think she might as well have told Mr. Morse
that the old journals were as much hers as mine;
but I think she likes to make out she is not as good
as she is. Sarah Foster helped us to do our arithmetic
examples to-day. She is splendid in mathematics.</p>

<p>Much to our surprise Bridget Flynn, who has
lived with us so long, is married. We didn&#8217;t know
she thought of such a thing, but she has gone.
Anna and I have learned how to make rice and cornstarch
puddings. We have a new girl in Bridget&#8217;s
place but I don&#8217;t think she will do. Grandmother
asked her to-day if she seasoned the gravy and she
said, either she did or she didn&#8217;t, she couldn&#8217;t tell
which. Grandfather says he thinks she is a little
lacking in the &#8220;upper story.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>June.</i>&mdash;A lot of us went down to Sucker Brook
this afternoon. Abbie Clark was one and she told
us some games to play sitting down on the grass.
We played &#8220;Simon says thumbs up&#8221; and then we
pulled the leaves off from daisies and said,</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<table summary='poetry' class='left2'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief,</p>
<p>Doctor, lawyer, merchant, chief,&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
</div>

<p>to see which we would marry. The last leaf tells
the story. Anna&#8217;s came &#8220;rich man&#8221; every time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>and she thinks it is true because Eugene Stone has
asked to marry her and he is quite well off. She is
13 and he is 17. He is going now to his home in
St. Paul, Minn., but he is coming back for her some
day. Tom Eddy is going to be groomsman and
Emma Wheeler bridesmaid. They have all the arrangements
made. She has not shown any of Eugene
Stone&#8217;s notes to Grandmother yet for she does
not think it is worth while. Anna broke the seal
on Tom Eddy&#8217;s page in her mystic book, although
he wrote on it, &#8220;Not to be opened until December
8, 1859.&#8221; He says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<span class='sc'>Dear Anna</span>,&mdash;I hope that in a few years I will
see you and Stone living on the banks of the
Mississippi, in a little cottage, as snug as a bug in a
rug, living in peace, so that I can come and see you
and have a good time.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<p style='text-align:right'><span class='sc'>Thos. C. Eddy</span>.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anna says if she does marry Eugene Stone and
he forgets, after two or three years to be as polite
to her as he is now she shall look up at him with her
sweetest smile and say, &#8220;Miss Anna, won&#8217;t you
have a little more sugar in your tea?&#8221; When I
went to school this morning Juliet Ripley asked,
&#8220;Where do you think Anna Richards is now? Up
in a cherry tree in Dr. Cheney&#8217;s garden.&#8221; Anna
loves cherries. We could see her from the chapel
window.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span><i>June</i> 7.&mdash;Alice Jewett took Anna all through
their new house to-day which is being built and
then they went over to Mr. Noah T. Clarke&#8217;s partly
finished house and went all through that. A dog
came out of Cat Alley and barked at them and
scared Anna awfully. She said she almost had a
conniption fit but Emma kept hold of her. She is
so afraid of thunder and lightning and dogs.</p>

<p>Old Friend Burling brought Grandfather a specimen
of his handwriting to-day to keep. It is beautifully
written, like copper plate. This is the verse
he wrote and Grandfather gave it to me to paste in
my book of extracts:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<table summary='poetry' class='left2'><tr><td>
<p style='text-align:center;'>DIVINE LOVE.</p>

<p>Transcribed by William S. Burling, Canandaigua,
1859, in the 83rd year of his age.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday, December</i> 8, 1859.&mdash;Mr. E. M. Morse is
our Sunday School teacher now and the Sunday
School room is so crowded that we go up into the
church for our class recitation. Abbie Clark, Fannie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>Gaylord and myself are the only scholars, and
he calls us the three Christian Graces, faith, hope and
charity, and the greatest of these is charity. I am
the tallest, so he says I am charity. We recite in
Mr. Gibson&#8217;s pew, because it is farthest away and
we do not disturb the other classes. He gave us
some excellent advice to-day as to what was right
and said if we ever had any doubts about anything
we should never do it and should always be perfectly
sure we are in the right before we act. He gave us
two weeks ago a poem to learn by Samuel Taylor
Coleridge. It is an apostrophe to God and very
hard to learn. It is blank verse and has 85 lines
in it. I have it committed at last and we are to
recite it in concert. The last two lines are, &#8220;Tell
thou the silent sky and tell the stars and tell yon
rising sun, Earth with its thousand voices praises
God.&#8221; Mr. Morse delivered a lecture in Bemis Hall
last Thursday night. The subject was, &#8220;You and I.&#8221;
It was splendid and he lent me the manuscript
afterwards to read. Dick Valentine lectured in the
hall the other night too. His subject was &#8220;Prejudice.&#8221;
There was some difference in the lectures
and the lecturers. The latter was more highly colored.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;The older ladies of the town have
formed a society for the relief of the poor and are
going to have a course of lectures in Bemis Hall
under their auspices to raise funds. The lecturers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>are to be from the village and are to be: Rev. O.
E. Daggett, subject, &#8220;Ladies and Gentlemen&#8221;; Dr.
Harvey Jewett, &#8220;The House We Live In&#8221;; Prof.
F. E. R. Chubbuck, &#8220;Progress&#8221;; Hon. H. W. Taylor,
&#8220;The Empty Place&#8221;; Prof. E. G. Tyler,
&#8220;Finance&#8221;; Mr. N. T. Clark, &#8220;Chemistry&#8221;; E. M.
Morse, &#8220;Graybeard and His Dogmas.&#8221; The young
ladies have started a society, too, and we have great
fun and fine suppers. We met at Jennie Howell&#8217;s
to organize. We are to meet once in two weeks and
are to present each member with an album bed quilt
with all our names on when they are married.
Susie Daggett says she is never going to be married,
but we must make her a quilt just the same. Laura
Chapin sang, &#8220;Mary Lindsey, Dear,&#8221; and we got
to laughing so that Susie Daggett and I lost our
equilibrium entirely, but I found mine by the time
I got home. Yesterday afternoon Grandfather
asked us if we did not want to go to ride with him
in the big two seated covered carriage which he does
not get out very often. We said yes, and he stopped
for Miss Hannah Upham and took her with us.
She sat on the back seat with me and we rode clear
to Farmington and kept up a brisk conversation all
the way. She told us how she became lady principal
of the Ontario Female Seminary in 1830. She
was still telling us about it when we got back home.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>December</i> 23.&mdash;We have had a Christmas tree
and many other attractions in Seminary chapel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>The day scholars and townspeople were permitted to
participate and we had a post office and received letters
from our friends. Mr. E. M. Morse wrote me
a fictitious one, claiming to be written from the
north pole ten years hence. I will copy it in my
journal for I may lose the letter. I had some gifts
on the Christmas tree and gave some. I presented
my teacher, Mr. Chubbuck, with two large hemstitched
handkerchiefs with his initials embroidered
in a corner of each. As he is favored with the
euphonious name of Frank Emery Robinson Chubbuck
it was a work of art to make his initials look
beautiful. I inclosed a stanza in rhyme:</p>

<div class='poetry'>

<p>Amid the changing scenes of life</p>

<p>Here is Mr. Morse&#8217;s letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p style='text-align:right;'>&#8220;<span class='sc'>North Pole</span>, 10 <i>January</i> 1869.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class='sc'>Miss Carrie Richards</span>,</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class='sc'>My Dear Young Friend</span>.&mdash;It is very cold here
and the pole is covered with ice. I climbed it yesterday
to take an observation and arrange our flag, the
Stars and Stripes, which I hoisted immediately on my
arrival here, ten years ago. I thought I should freeze
and the pole was so slippery that I was in great
danger of coming down faster than was comfortable.
Although this pole has been used for more than 6,000
years it is still as good as new. The works of the
Great Architect do not wear out. It is now ten years
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>since I have seen you and my other two Christian
Graces and I have no doubt of your present position
among the most brilliant, noble and excellent women
in all America. I always knew and recognized your
great abilities. Nature was very generous to you all
and you were enjoying fine advantages at the time
I last knew you. I thought your residence with your
Grandparents an admirable school for you, and you
and your sister were most evidently the best joy of
their old age. You certainly owe much to them. At
the time that I left my three Christian Graces, Mrs.
Grundy was sometimes malicious enough to say that
they were injuring themselves by flirting. I always
told the old lady that I had the utmost confidence in
the judgment and discretion of my pupils and that
they would be very careful and prudent in all their
conduct. I confessed that flirting was wrong and
very injurious to any one who was guilty of it, but
I was very sure that you were not. I could not believe
that you would disappoint us all and become only
ordinary women, but that you would become the most
exalted characters, scorning all things unworthy of
ladies and Christians and I was right and Mrs. Grundy
was wrong. When the ice around the pole thaws out
I shall make a flying visit to Canandaigua. I send
you a tame polar bear for a playfellow. This letter
will be conveyed to you by Esquimaux express.&mdash;Most
truly yours,</p>

<p style='text-align:right;'><span class='sc'>E. M. Morse</span>.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think some one must have shown some verses
that we girls wrote, to Mrs. Grundy and made her
think that our minds were more upon the young
men than they were upon our studies, but if people
knew how much time we spent on Paley&#8217;s &#8220;Evidences
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>of Christianity&#8221; and Butler&#8217;s Analogy and
Kames&#8217; Elements of Criticism and Tytler&#8217;s Ancient
History and Olmstead&#8217;s Mathematical Astronomy
and our French and Latin and arithmetic and algebra
and geometry and trigonometry and bookkeeping,
they would know we had very little time to
think of the masculine gender.</p>

<p><i>New Year&#8217;s Day.</i>&mdash;We felt quite grown up to-day
and not a little scared when we saw Mr. Morse and
Mr. Wells and Mr. Mason and Mr. Chubbuck all
coming in together to make a New Year&#8217;s call.
They made a tour of the town. We did not feel
so flustrated when Will Schley and Horace Finley
came in later. Mr. Oliver Phelps, Jr., came to call
upon Grandmother. Grandfather made a few calls,
too.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>January</i> 5.&mdash;Abbie Clark and I went up to see
Miss Emma Morse because it is her birthday. We
call her sweet Miss Emma and we think Mr. Manning
Wells does, too. We went to William Wirt
Howe&#8217;s lecture in Bemis Hall this evening. He is
a very smart young man.</p>

<p>Anna wanted to walk down a little ways with the
girls after school so she crouched down between
Helen Coy and Hattie Paddock and walked past the
house. Grandmother always sits in the front window,
so when Anna came in she asked her if she
had to stay after school and Anna gave her an
evasive answer. It reminds me of a story I read,
of a lady who told the servant girl if any one called
to give an evasive answer as she did not wish to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>receive calls that day. By and by the door bell
rang and the servant went to the door. When she
came back the lady asked her how she dismissed the
visitor. She said, &#8220;Shure ye towld me to give an
evasive answer, so when the man asked if the lady
of the house was at home I said, &#8216;Faith! is your
grandmother a monkey!&#8217;&#8221; We never say anything
like that to our &#8220;dear little lady,&#8221; but we just change
the subject and divert the conversation into a more
agreeable channel. To-day some one came to see
Grandmother when we were gone and told her that
Anna and some others ran away from school.
Grandmother told Anna she hoped she would never
let any one bring her such a report again. Anna
said she would not, if she could possibly help it!
I wonder who it was. Some one who believes in
the text, &#8220;Look not every man on his own things,
but every man also on the things of others.&#8221;
Grandfather told us to-night that we ought to be
very careful what we do as we are making history
every day. Anna says she shall try not to have hers
as dry as some that she had to learn at school to-day.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>February</i> 9.&mdash;Dear Miss Mary Howell was married
to-day to Mr. Worthington, of Cincinnati.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>February</i> 28.&mdash;Grandfather asked me to read
Abraham Lincoln&#8217;s speech aloud which he delivered
in Cooper Institute, New York, last evening, under
the auspices of the Republican Club. He was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>escorted to the platform by David Dudley Field and
introduced by William Cullen Bryant. The <i>New
York Times</i> called him &#8220;a noted political exhorter
and Prairie orator.&#8221; It was a thrilling talk and
must have stirred men&#8217;s souls.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>April</i> 1.&mdash;Aunt Ann was over to see us yesterday
and she said she made a visit the day before out at
Mrs. William Gorham&#8217;s. Mrs. Phelps and Miss
Eliza Chapin also went and they enjoyed talking
over old times when they were young. Maggie
Gorham is going to be married on the 25th to Mr.
Benedict of New York. She always said she would
not marry a farmer and would not live in a cobblestone
house and now she is going to do both, for
Mr. Benedict has bought the farm near theirs and
it has a cobblestone house. We have always
thought her one of the jolliest and prettiest of the
older set of young ladies.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>June.</i>&mdash;James writes that he has seen the Prince
of Wales in New York. He was up on the roof of
the Continental Fire Insurance building, out on the
cornice, and looked down on the procession. Afterwards
there was a reception for the Prince at the
University Law School and James saw him close by.
He says he has a very pleasant youthful face.
There was a ball given for him one evening in the
Academy of Music and there were 3,000 present.
The ladies who danced with him will never forget
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>it. They say that he enters into every diversion
which is offered to him with the greatest tact and
good nature, and when he visited Mount Vernon he
showed great reverence for the memory of George
Washington. He attended a literary entertainment
in Boston, where Longfellow, Holmes, Emerson,
Thoreau, and other Americans of distinction were
presented to him. He will always be a favorite in
America.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>June.</i>&mdash;Mrs. Annie Granger asked Anna and me
to come over to her house and see her baby. We
were very eager to go and wanted to hold it and
carry it around the room. She was willing but
asked us if we had any pins on us anywhere. She
said she had the nurse sew the baby&#8217;s clothes on
every morning so that if she cried she would know
whether it was pains or pins. We said we had no
pins on us, so we stayed quite a while and held little
Miss Hattie to our heart&#8217;s content. She is named
for her aunt, Hattie Granger. Anna says she thinks
Miss Martha Morse will give medals to her and
Mary Daggett for being the most meddlesome girls
in school, judging from the number of times she
has spoken to them to-day. Anna is getting to be a
regular punster, although I told her that Blair&#8217;s
Rhetoric says that punning is not the highest kind
of wit. Mr. Morse met us coming from school in
the rain and said it would not hurt us as we were
neither sugar nor salt. Anna said, &#8220;No, but we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>are &#8217;lasses.&#8221; Grandmother has been giving us sulphur
and molasses for the purification of the blood
and we have to take it three mornings and then skip
three mornings. This morning Anna commenced
going through some sort of gymnastics and Grandmother
asked her what she was doing, and she said
it was her first morning to skip.</p>

<p>Abbie Clark had a large tea-party this afternoon
and evening&mdash;Seminary girls and a few Academy
boys. We had a fine supper and then played games.
Abbie gave us one which is a test of memory and we
tried to learn it from her but she was the only one
who could complete it. I can write it down, but
not say it:</p>

<p>A good fat hen.</p>

<p>Two ducks and a good fat hen.</p>

<p>Three plump partridges, two ducks and a good
fat hen.</p>

<p>Four squawking wild geese, three plump partridges,
etc.</p>

<p>Five hundred Limerick oysters.</p>

<p>Six pairs of Don Alfonso&#8217;s tweezers.</p>

<p>Seven hundred rank and file Macedonian horsemen
drawn up in line of battle.</p>

<p>Eight cages of heliogabalus sparrow kites.</p>

<p>Nine sympathetical, epithetical, categorical propositions.</p>

<p>Ten tentapherical tubes.</p>

<p>Eleven flat bottom fly boats sailing between Madagascar
and Mount Palermo.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>Twelve European dancing masters, sent to teach
the Egyptian mummies how to dance, against Hercules&#8217;
wedding day.</p>

<p>Abbie says it was easier to learn than the multiplication
table. They wanted some of us to recite
and Abbie Clark gave us Lowell&#8217;s poem, &#8220;John P.
Robinson, he, says the world&#8217;ll go right if he only
says Gee!&#8221; I gave another of Lowell&#8217;s poems,
&#8220;The Courtin&#8217;.&#8221; Julia Phelps had her guitar with
her by request and played and sang for us very
sweetly. Fred Harrington went home with her and
Theodore Barnum with me.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;Frankie Richardson asked me to go
with her to teach a class in the colored Sunday
School on Chapel Street this afternoon. I asked
Grandmother if I could go and she said she never
noticed that I was particularly interested in the colored
race and she said she thought I only wanted an
excuse to get out for a walk Sunday afternoon.
However, she said I could go just this once. When
we got up as far as the Academy, Mr. Noah T.
Clarke&#8217;s brother, who is one of the teachers, came
out and Frank said he led the singing at the Sunday
School and she said she would give me an introduction
to him, so he walked up with us and home
again. Grandmother said that when she saw him
opening the gate for me, she understood my zeal in
missionary work. &#8220;The dear little lady,&#8221; as we
often call her, has always been noted for her keen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>discernment and wonderful sagacity and loses none
of it as she advances in years. Some one asked
Anna the other day if her Grandmother retained
all her faculties and Anna said, &#8220;Yes, indeed, to an
alarming degree.&#8221; Grandmother knows that we
think she is a perfect angel even if she does seem
rather strict sometimes. Whether we are 7 or
17 we are children to her just the same, and the
Bible says, &#8220;Children obey your parents in the
Lord for this is right.&#8221; We are glad that we never
will seem old to her. I had the same company home
from church in the evening. His home is in
Naples.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;This morning the cook went to early
mass and Anna told Grandmother she would bake
the pancakes for breakfast if she would let her put
on gloves. She would not let her, so Hannah baked
the cakes. I was invited to Mary Paul&#8217;s to supper
to-night and drank the first cup of tea I ever drank
in my life. I had a very nice time and Johnnie Paul
came home with me.</p>

<p>Imogen Power and I went down together Friday
afternoon to buy me a Meteorology. We are studying
that and Watts on the Mind, instead of
Philosophy.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;I went with Fanny Gaylord to see
Mrs. Callister at the hotel to-night. She is so interested
in all that we tell her, just like &#8220;one of the
girls.&#8221;</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='i124'></a>
<img src='images/illus-124.jpg' alt='' />
<p class='c'>The Old Canandaigua Academy</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>I was laughing to-day when I came in from the
street and Grandmother asked me what amused me
so. I told her that I met Mr. and Mrs. Putnam
on the street and she looked so immense and he so
minute I couldn&#8217;t help laughing at the contrast.
Grandmother said that size was not everything, and
then she quoted Cowper&#8217;s verse:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<table summary='poetry' class='left2'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;Were I so tall to reach the skies or grasp the ocean in a span,</p>
<p>I must be measured by my soul, the mind is the stature of the man.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
</div>

<p>I don&#8217;t believe that helps Mr. Putnam out.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;We went to Monthly Concert of prayer
for Foreign Missions this evening. I told Grandmother
that I thought it was not very interesting.
Judge Taylor read the <i>Missionary Herald</i> about the
Madagascans and the Senegambians and the Terra
del Fuegans and then Deacon Tyler prayed and they
sang &#8220;From Greenland&#8217;s Icy Mountains&#8221; and took
up a collection and went home. She said she was
afraid I did not listen attentively. I don&#8217;t think
I did strain every nerve. I believe Grandmother
will give her last cent to Missions if the Boards get
into worse straits than they are now.</p>

<p>In Latin class to-day Anna translated the phrase
Deo Volente &#8220;with violence,&#8221; and Mr. Tyler, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>always enjoys a joke, laughed so, we thought he
would fall out of his chair. He evidently thought
it was the best one he had heard lately.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>November</i> 21.&mdash;Aunt Ann gave me a sewing bird
to screw on to the table to hold my work instead of
pinning it to my knee. Grandmother tells us when
we sew or read not to get everything around us that
we will want for the next two hours because it is
not healthy to sit in one position so long. She
wants us to get up and &#8220;stir around.&#8221; Anna does
not need this advice as much as I do for she is
always on what Miss Achert calls the &#8220;qui vive.&#8221; I
am trying to make a sofa pillow out of little pieces
of silk. Aunt Ann taught me how. You have
to cut pieces of paper into octagonal shape and
cover them with silk and then sew them together,
over and over. They are beautiful, with bright
colors, when they are done. There was a hop at
the hotel last night and some of the girls went and
had an elegant time. Mr. Hiram Metcalf came here
this morning to have Grandmother sign some papers.
He always looks very dignified, and Anna and I call
him &#8220;the deed man.&#8221; We tried to hear what he
said to Grandmother after she signed her name
but we only heard something about &#8220;fear or compulsion&#8221;
and Grandmother said &#8220;yes.&#8221; It seems
very mysterious. Grandfather took us down street
to-day to see the new Star Building. It was the
town house and he bought it and got Mr. Warren
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>Stoddard of Hopewell to superintend cutting it in
two and moving the parts separately to Coach
Street. When it was completed the shout went up
from the crowd, &#8220;Hurrah for Thomas Beals, the
preserver of the old Court House.&#8221; No one but
Grandfather thought it could be done.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>December.</i>&mdash;I went with the girls to the lake to
skate this afternoon. Mr. Johnson, the colored
barber, is the best skater in town. He can skate
forwards and backwards and cut all sorts of curlicues,
although he is such a heavy man. He is going
to Liberia and there his skates won&#8217;t do him any
good. I wish he would give them to me and also
his skill to use them. Some one asked me to sit
down after I got home and I said I preferred to
stand, as I had been sitting down all the afternoon!
Gus Coleman took a load of us sleigh-riding this
evening. Of course he had Clara Willson sit on the
front seat with him and help him drive.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;We had a special meeting of our
society this evening at Mary Wheeler&#8217;s and invited
the gentlemen and had charades and general good
time. Mr. Gillette and Horace Finley made a great
deal of fun for us. We initiated Mr. Gillette into
the Dorcas Society, which consists in seating the
candidate in a chair and propounding some very
solemn questions and then in token of desire to join
the society, you ask him to open his mouth very wide
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>for a piece of cake which you swallow, yourself,
instead! Very disappointing to the new member!</p>

<p>We went to a concert at the Seminary this evening.
Miss Mollie Bull sang &#8220;Coming Through the
Rye&#8221; and Miss Lizzie Bull sang &#8220;Annie Laurie&#8221;
and &#8220;Auld Lang Syne.&#8221; Jennie Lind, herself,
could not have done better.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>December</i> 15.&mdash;Alice Jewett, Emma Wheeler and
Anna are in Mrs. Worthington&#8217;s Sunday School
class and as they have recently united with the
church, she thought they should begin practical
Christian work by distributing tracts among the
neglected classes. So this afternoon they ran away
from school to begin the good work. It was so
bright and pleasant, they thought a walk to the lake
would be enjoyable and they could find a welcome in
some humble home. The girls wanted Anna to be
the leader, but she would only promise that if something
pious came into her mind, she would say it.
They knocked at a door and were met by a smiling
mother of twelve children and asked to come in.
They sat down feeling somewhat embarrassed, but
spying a photograph album on the table, they became
much interested, while the children explained
the pictures. Finally Anna felt that it was time
to do something, so when no one was looking, she
slipped under one of the books on the table, three
tracts entitled &#8220;Consolation for the Bereaved,&#8221;
&#8220;Systematic Benevolence&#8221; and &#8220;The Social Evils
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>of dancing, card playing and theater-going.&#8221; Then
they said goodbye to their new friends and started
on. They decided not to do any more pastoral
work until another day, but enjoyed the outing very
much.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Christmas.</i>&mdash;We all went to Aunt Mary Carr&#8217;s
to dinner excepting Grandmother, and in the evening
we went to see some tableaux at Dr. Cook&#8217;s and Dr.
Chapin&#8217;s at the asylum. We were very much
pleased with the entertainment. Between the acts
Mr. del Pratt, one of the patients, said every time,
&#8220;What next!&#8221; which made every one laugh.</p>

<p>Grandfather was requested to add his picture to
the gallery of portraits of eminent men for the
Court Room, so he has had it painted. An artist
by the name of Green, who lives in town, has finished
it after numerous sittings and brought it up
for our approval. We like it but we do not think
it is as good looking as he is. No one could really
satisfy us probably, so we may as well try to be
suited.</p>

<p>I asked Grandmother if Mr. Clarke could take
Sunday night supper with us and she said she was
afraid he did not know the catechism. I asked him
Friday night and he said he would learn it on Saturday
so that he could answer every third question any
way. So he did and got along very well. I think
he deserved a pretty good supper.</p>

<p class='cln0'>1861</p>
</div>

<p><i>March</i> 4, 1861.&mdash;President Lincoln was inaugurated
to-day.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>March</i> 5.&mdash;I read the inaugural address aloud to
Grandfather this evening. He dwelt with such
pathos upon the duty that all, both North and South,
owe to the Union, it does not seem as though there
could be war!</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>April.</i>&mdash;We seem to have come to a sad, sad time.
The Bible says, &#8220;A man&#8217;s worst foes are those of
his own household.&#8221; The whole United States has
been like one great household for many years.
&#8220;United we stand, divided we fall!&#8221; has been our
watchword, but some who should have been its best
friends have proven false and broken the bond.
Men are taking sides, some for the North, some for
the South. Hot words and fierce looks have followed,
and there has been a storm in the air for a
long time.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>April</i> 15.&mdash;The storm has broken upon us. The
Confederates fired on Fort Sumter, just off the
coast of South Carolina, and forced her on April
14 to haul down the flag and surrender. President
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>Lincoln has issued a call for 75,000 men and many
are volunteering to go all around us. How strange
and awful it seems.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>May,</i> 1861.&mdash;Many of the young men are going
from Canandaigua and all the neighboring towns.
It seems very patriotic and grand when they are
singing, &#8220;It is sweet, Oh, &#8217;tis sweet, for one&#8217;s country
to die,&#8221; and we hear the martial music and see
the flags flying and see the recruiting tents on the
square and meet men in uniform at every turn and
see train loads of the boys in blue going to the front,
but it will not seem so grand if we hear they are dead
on the battlefield, far from home. A lot of us girls
went down to the train and took flowers to the soldiers
as they were passing through and they cut
buttons from their coats and gave to us as souvenirs.
We have flags on our paper and envelopes, and have
all our stationery bordered with red, white and blue.
We wear little flag pins for badges and tie our hair
with red, white and blue ribbon and have pins and
earrings made of the buttons the soldiers gave us.
We are going to sew for them in our society and
get the garments all cut from the older ladies&#8217;
society. They work every day in one of the rooms
of the court house and cut out garments and make
them and scrape lint and roll up bandages. They
say they will provide us with all the garments we
will make. We are going to write notes and enclose
them in the garments to cheer up the soldier boys.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>It does not seem now as though I could give up any
one who belonged to me. The girls in our society
say that if any of the members do send a soldier to
the war they shall have a flag bed quilt, made by the
society, and have the girls&#8217; names on the stars.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>May</i> 20.&mdash;I recited &#8220;Scott and the Veteran&#8221; to-day
at school, and Mary Field recited, &#8220;To Drum
Beat and Heart Beat a Soldier Marches By&#8221;; Anna
recited &#8220;The Virginia Mother.&#8221; Every one learns
war poems nowadays. There was a patriotic
rally in Bemis Hall last night and a quartette sang,
&#8220;The Sword of Bunker Hill&#8221; and &#8220;Dixie&#8221; and
&#8220;John Brown&#8217;s Body Lies a Mouldering in the
Grave,&#8221; and many other patriotic songs. We have
one West Point cadet, Albert M. Murray, who is
in the thick of the fight, and Charles S. Coy represents
Canandaigua in the navy.</p>

<p class='c'>The Ontario Female Seminary</p>
</div>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span><i>June,</i> 1861.&mdash;At the anniversary exercises, Rev.
Samuel M. Hopkins of Auburn gave the address. I
have graduated from Ontario Female Seminary
after a five years course and had the honor of receiving
a diploma from the courtly hands of General
John A. Granger. I am going to have it
framed and handed down to my grandchildren as a
memento, not exactly of sleepless nights and midnight
vigils, but of rising betimes, at what Anna
calls the crack of dawn. She likes that expression
better than daybreak. I heard her reciting in the
back chamber one morning about 4 o&#8217;clock and listened
at the door. She was saying in the most
nonchalant manner: &#8220;Science and literature in
England were fast losing all traces of originality,
invention was discouraged, research unvalued and
the examination of nature proscribed. It seemed to
be generally supposed that the treasure accumulated
in the preceding ages was quite sufficient for all
national purposes and that the only duty which
authors had to perform was to reproduce what had
thus been accumulated, adorned with all the graces
of polished style. Tameness and monotony naturally
result from a slavish adherence to all arbitrary
rules and every branch of literature felt this
blighting influence. History, perhaps, was in some
degree an exception, for Hume, Robertson and more
especially Gibbon, exhibited a spirit of original investigation
which found no parallel among their
contemporaries.&#8221; I looked in and asked her where
her book was, and she said she left it down stairs.
She has &#8220;got it&#8221; all right, I am sure. We helped
decorate the seminary chapel for two days. Our
motto was, &#8220;Still achieving, still pursuing.&#8221; Miss
Guernsey made most of the letters and Mr. Chubbuck
put them up and he hung all the paintings. It
was a very warm week. General Granger had to
use his palm leaf fan all the time, as well as the
rest of us. There were six in our class, Mary Field,
Lucy Petherick, Kate Lilly, Sarah Clay, Abby Scott
and myself. Abbie Clark would have been in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>class, but she went to Pittsfield, Mass., instead.
General Granger said to each one of us, &#8220;It gives me
great pleasure to present you with this diploma,&#8221;
and when he gave Miss Scott hers, as she is from
Alabama, he said he wished it might be as a flag of
truce between the North and the South, and this
sentiment was loudly cheered. General Granger
looked so handsome with his black dress suit and
ruffled shirt front and all the natural grace which
belongs to him. The sheepskin has a picture of the
Seminary on it and this inscription: &#8220;The Trustees
and Faculty of the Ontario Female Seminary
hereby certify that <span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;</span><span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;</span> has completed the
course of study prescribed in this Institution, maintained
the requisite scholarship and commendable
deportment and is therefore admitted to the graduating
honors of this Institution. President of
Board, John A. Granger; Benjamin F. Richards,
Edward G. Tyler, Principals.&#8221; Mr. Morse wrote
something for the paper:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;To the Editor of the Repository:</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>&mdash;June roses, etc., make our loveliest of
villages a paradise this week. The constellations are
all glorious and the stars of earth far outshine those
of the heavens. The lake shore, &#8216;Lovers&#8217; Lane,&#8217;
&#8216;Glen Kitty&#8217; and the &#8216;Points&#8217; are full of romance and
romancers. The yellow moon and the blue waters
and the dark green shores and the petrified Indians,
whispering stony words at the foot of Genundewah,
and Squaw Island sitting on the waves, like an enchanted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>grove, and &#8216;Whalesback&#8217; all humped up in
the East and &#8216;Devil&#8217;s Lookout&#8217; rising over all, made
the &#8216;Sleeping Beauty&#8217; a silver sea of witchery and
love; and in the cottages and palaces we ate the
ambrosia and drank the nectar of the sweet goddesses
of this new and golden age.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may as well say to you, Mr. Editor, that the
Ontario Female Seminary closed yesterday and
&#8216;Yours truly&#8217; was present at the commencement. Being
a bachelor I shall plead guilty and appeal to the
mercy of the Court, if indicted for undue prejudice
in favor of the charming young orators. After the
report of the Examining Committee, in which the
scholarship of the young ladies was not too highly
praised, came the Latin Salutatory by Miss Clay, a
most beautiful and elegant production (that sentence,
sir, applies to both salutatory and salutatorian). The
&#8216;Shadows We Cast,&#8217; by Miss Field, carried us far into
the beautiful fields of nature and art and we saw
the dark, or the brilliant shades, which our lives will
cast, upon society and history. Then &#8216;Tongues in
Trees&#8217; began to whisper most bewitchingly, and
&#8216;Books in the Running Brooks&#8217; were opened, and
&#8216;Sermons in Stones&#8217; were preached by Miss Richards,
and this old bachelor thought if all trees would talk
so well, and every brook would babble so musically,
and each precious stone would exhort so brilliantly,
as they were made to do by the &#8216;enchantress,&#8217; angels
and dreams would henceforth be of little consequence;
and whether the orator should be called &#8216;Tree of
Beauty,&#8217; &#8216;Minnehaha&#8217; or the &#8216;Kohinoor&#8217; is a &#8216;vexata
questio.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the evening Mr. Hardick, &#8216;our own,&#8217; whose
hand never touches the piano without making
delicious music, and Misses Daggett and Wilson, also
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>&#8216;our own,&#8217; and the musical pupils of the Institution,
gave a concert. &#8216;The Young Volunteer&#8217; was imperatively
demanded, and this for the third time during the
anniversary exercises, and was sung amid thunders
of applause, &#8216;Star of the South,&#8217; Miss Stella Scott,
shining meanwhile in all her radiant beauty. May her
glorious light soon rest on a Union that shall never
more be broken.&mdash;Soberly yours,</p>

<p style='text-align:right;'><span class='sc'>A Very Old Bachelor.</span>&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>June,</i> 1861.&mdash;There was a patriotic rally this
afternoon on the campus of Canandaigua Academy
and we Seminary girls went. They raised a flag
on the Academy building. General Granger presided,
Dr. Coleman led the choir and they sang
&#8220;The Star Spangled Banner.&#8221; Mr. Noah T.
Clarke made a stirring speech and Mr. Gideon
Granger, James C. Smith and E. M. Morse followed.
Canandaigua has already raised over
$7,000 for the war. Capt. Barry drills the Academy
boys in military tactics on the campus every
day. Men are constantly enlisting. Lester P.
Thompson, son of &#8220;Father Thompson,&#8221; among the
others.</p>

<p>A young man asked Anna to take a drive to-day,
but Grandmother was not willing at first to let her
go. She finally gave her consent, after Anna&#8217;s plea
that he was so young and his horse was so gentle.
Just as they were ready to start, I heard Anna run
upstairs and I heard him say, &#8220;What an Anna!&#8221;
I asked her afterwards what she went for and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>said she remembered that she had left the soap in
the water.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>June.</i>&mdash;Dr. Daggett&#8217;s war sermon from the 146th
Psalm was wonderful.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>December</i> 1.&mdash;Dr. Carr is dead. He had a stroke
of paralysis two weeks ago and for several days he
has been unconscious. The choir of our church,
of which he was leader for so long, and some of the
young people came and stood around his bed and
sang, &#8220;Jesus, Lover of My Soul.&#8221; They did not
know whether he was conscious or not, but they
thought so because the tears ran down his cheeks
from his closed eyelids, though he could not speak
or move. The funeral was from the church and
Dr. Daggett&#8217;s text was, &#8220;The Beloved Physician.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>January</i> 26.&mdash;We went to the Baptist Church this
evening to hear Rev. A. H. Lung preach his last
sermon before going into the army.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>February</i> 17.&mdash;Glorious news from the war to-day.
Fort Donelson is taken with 1,500 rebels.
The right and the North will surely triumph!</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>February</i> 21.&mdash;Our society met at Fanny Palmer&#8217;s
this afternoon. I went but did not stay to tea as
we were going to Madame Anna Bishop&#8217;s concert
in the evening. The concert was very, very good.
Her voice has great scope and she was dressed in
the latest stage costume, but it took so much material
for her skirt that there was hardly any left for
the waist.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span><i>Washington&#8217;s Birthday.</i>&mdash;Patriotic services were
held in the Congregational Church this morning.
Madame Anna Bishop sang, and National songs
were sung. Hon. James C. Smith read Washington&#8217;s
Farewell Address. In the afternoon a party
of twenty-two, young and old, took a ride in the
Seminary boat and went to Mr. Paton&#8217;s on the lake
shore road. We carried flags and made it a patriotic occasion. I sat next to Spencer F. Lincoln,
a young man from Naples who is studying law in
Mr. Henry Chesebro&#8217;s office. I never met him before
but he told me he had made up his mind to
go to the war. It is wonderful that young men
who have brilliant prospects before them at home,
will offer themselves upon the altar of their country.
I have some new patriotic stationery. There
is a picture of the flag on the envelope and underneath,
&#8220;If any one attempts to haul down the
American flag shoot him on the spot.&mdash;<span class='sc'>John A.
Dix.</span>&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday, February</i> 23.&mdash;Everybody came out to
church this morning, expecting to hear Madame
Anna Bishop sing. She was not there, and an
&#8220;agent&#8221; made a &#8220;statement.&#8221; The audience did
not appear particularly edified.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>March</i> 4.&mdash;John B. Gough lectured in Bemis Hall
last night and was entertained by Governor Clark.
I told Grandfather that I had an invitation to the
lecture and he asked me who from. I told him
from Mr. Noah T. Clarke&#8217;s brother. He did not
make the least objection and I was awfully glad,
because he has asked me to the whole course. Wendell
Phillips and Horace Greeley, E. H. Chapin and
John G. Saxe and Bayard Taylor are expected.
John B. Gough&#8217;s lecture was fine. He can make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>an audience laugh as much by wagging his coat tails
as some men can by talking an hour.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>March</i> 26.&mdash;I have been up at Laura Chapin&#8217;s
from 10 o&#8217;clock in the morning until 10 at night, finishing
Jennie Howell&#8217;s bed quilt, as she is to be
married very soon. Almost all of the girls were
there. We finished it at 8 p. m. and when we took
it off the frames we gave three cheers. Some of
the youth of the village came up to inspect our handiwork
and see us home. Before we went Julia
Phelps sang and played on the guitar and Captain
Barry also sang and we all sang together, &#8220;O! Columbia,
the gem of the ocean, three cheers for the
red, white and blue.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>June</i> 19.&mdash;Our cousin, Ann Eliza Field, was married
to-day to George B. Bates at her home on Gibson
Street. We went and had an elegant time.
Charlie Wheeler made great fun and threw the final
shower of rice as they drove away.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>June.</i>&mdash;There was great excitement in prayer
meeting last night, it seemed to Abbie Clark, Mary
Field and me on the back seat where we always sit.
Several people have asked us why we sit away back
there by old Mrs. Kinney, but we tell them that she
sits on the other side of the stove from us and we
like the seat, because we have occupied it so long.
I presume we would see less and hear more if we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>sat in front. To-night just after Mr. Walter Hubbell
had made one of his most beautiful prayers and
Mr. Cyrus Dixon was praying, a big June bug came
zipping into the room and snapped against the wall
and the lights and barely escaped several bald heads.
Anna kept dodging around in a most startling manner
and I expected every moment to see her walk
out and take Emma Wheeler with her, for if she
is afraid of anything more than dogs it is June bugs.
At this crisis the bug flew out and a cat stealthily
walked in. We knew that dear Mrs. Taylor was
always unpleasantly affected by the sight of cats
and we didn&#8217;t know what would happen if the cat
should go near her. The cat very innocently
ascended the steps to the desk and as Judge and Mrs.
Taylor always sit on the front seat, she couldn&#8217;t
help observing the ambitious animal as it started to
assist Dr. Daggett in conducting the meeting. The
result was that Mrs. Taylor just managed to reach
the outside door before fainting away. We were
glad when the benediction was pronounced.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>June.</i>&mdash;Anna and I had a serenade last night from
the Academy Glee Club, I think, as their voices
sounded familiar. We were awakened by the
music, about 11 p. m., quite suddenly and I thought
I would step across the hall to the front chamber for
a match to light the candle. I was only half awake,
however, and lost my bearings and stepped off the
stairs and rolled or slid to the bottom. The stairs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>are winding, so I must have performed two or three
revolutions before I reached my destination. I
jumped up and ran back and found Anna sitting up
in bed, laughing. She asked me where I had been
and said if I had only told her where I was going
she would have gone for me. We decided not to
strike a light, but just listen to the singing. Anna
said she was glad that the leading tenor did not
know how quickly I &#8220;tumbled&#8221; to the words of
his song, &#8220;O come my love and be my own, nor
longer let me dwell alone,&#8221; for she thought he would
be too much flattered. Grandfather came into the
hall and asked if any bones were broken and if he
should send for a doctor. We told him we guessed
not, we thought we would be all right in the morning.
He thought it was Anna who fell down stairs,
as he is never looking for such exploits in me. We
girls received some verses from the Academy boys,
written by Greig Mulligan, under the assumed name
of Simon Snooks. The subject was, &#8220;The Poor
Unfortunate Academy Boys.&#8221; We have answered
them and now I fear Mrs. Grundy will see them
and imagine something serious is going on. But
she is mistaken and will find, at the end of the session,
our hearts are still in our own possession.</p>

<p>When we were down at Sucker Brook the other
afternoon we were watching the water and one of
the girls said, &#8220;How nice it would be if our lives
could run along as smoothly as this stream.&#8221; I said
I thought it would be too monotonous. Laura
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>Chapin said she supposed I would rather have an
&#8220;eddy&#8221; in mine.</p>

<p>We went to the examination at the Academy to-day
and to the gymnasium exercises afterwards.
Mr. Noah T. Clarke&#8217;s brother leads them and they
do some great feats with their rings and swings and
weights and ladders. We girls can do a few in
the bowling alley at the Seminary.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>June.</i>&mdash;I visited Eureka Lawrence in Syracuse
and we attended commencement at Hamilton College,
Clinton, and saw there, James Tunnicliff and
Stewart Ellsworth of Penn Yan. I also saw Darius
Sackett there among the students and also became
acquainted with a very interesting young man from
Syracuse, with the classic name of Horace Publius
Virgilius Bogue. Both of these young men are
studying for the ministry. I also saw Henry P.
Cook, who used to be one of the Academy boys, and
Morris Brown, of Penn Yan. They talk of leaving
college and going to the war and so does Darius
Sackett.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>July,</i> 1862.&mdash;The President has called for 300,000
more brave men to fill up the ranks of the fallen.
We hear every day of more friends and acquaintances
who have volunteered to go.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>August</i> 20.&mdash;The 126th Regiment, just organized,
was mustered into service at Camp Swift, Geneva.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>Those that I know who belong to it are Colonel
E. S. Sherrill, Lieutenant Colonel James M. Bull,
Captain Charles A. Richardson, Captain Charles M.
Wheeler, Captain Ten Eyck Munson, Captain Orin
G. Herendeen, Surgeon Dr. Charles S. Hoyt, Hospital
Steward Henry T. Antes, First Lieutenant
Charles Gage, Second Lieutenant Spencer F. Lincoln,
First Sergeant Morris Brown, Corporal Hollister
N. Grimes, Privates Darius Sackett, Henry
Willson, Oliver Castle, William Lamport.</p>

<p>Dr. Hoyt wrote home: &#8220;God bless the dear
ones we leave behind; and while you try to perform
the duties you owe to each other, we will try to
perform ours.&#8221;</p>

<p>We saw by the papers that the volunteers of the
regiment before leaving camp at Geneva allotted
over $15,000 of their monthly pay to their families
and friends at home. One soldier sent this telegram
to his wife, as the regiment started for the front:
&#8220;God bless you. Hail Columbia. Kiss the baby.
Write soon.&#8221; A volume in ten words.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>August.</i>&mdash;The New York State S. S. convention
is convened here and the meetings are most interesting.
They were held in our church and lasted three
days. A Mr. Hart, from New York, led the singing
and Mr. Ralph Wells was Moderator. Mr.
Noah T. Clarke was in his element all through the
meetings. Mr. Pardee gave some fine blackboard
exercises. During the last afternoon Mr. Tousley
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>was wheeled into the church, in his invalid chair,
and said a few words, which thrilled every one.
So much tenderness, mingled with his old time enthusiasm
and love for the cause. It is the last time
probably that his voice will ever be heard in public.
They closed the grand meeting with the hymn beginning:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<table summary='poetry' class='left2'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;Blest be the tie that binds</p>
<p>Our hearts in Christian love.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
</div>

<p>In returning thanks to the people of Canandaigua
for their generous entertainment, Mr. Ralph Wells
facetiously said that the cost of the convention must
mean something to Canandaigua people, for the
cook in one home was heard to say, &#8220;These religiouses
do eat awful!&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>September</i> 13.&mdash;Darius Sackett was wounded by
a musket shot in the leg, at Maryland Heights, Va.,
and in consequence is discharged from the service.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>September.</i>&mdash;Edgar A. Griswold of Naples is recruiting
a company here for the 148th Regiment, of
which he is captain. Hiram P. Brown, Henry S.
Murray and Charles H. Paddock are officers in the
company. Dr. Elnathan W. Simmons is surgeon.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>September</i> 22.&mdash;I read aloud to Grandfather this
evening the Emancipation Proclamation issued as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>a war measure by President Lincoln, to take effect
January 1, liberating over three million slaves. He
recommends to all thus set free, to labor faithfully
for reasonable wages and to abstain from all violence,
unless in necessary self-defense, and he invokes
upon this act &#8220;the considerate judgment of
mankind and the gracious favor of Almighty God.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>November</i> 21.&mdash;This is my twentieth birthday.
Anna wanted to write a poem for the occasion and
this morning she handed me what she called &#8220;An
effort.&#8221; She said she wrestled with it all night long
and could not sleep and this was the result:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<table summary='poetry' class='left2'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;One hundred years from now, Carrie dear,</p>
<p>In all probability you&#8217;ll not be here;</p>
<p>But we&#8217;ll all be in the same boat, too,</p>
<p>And there&#8217;ll be no one left</p>
<p style='margin-left:2ex'>  To say boo hoo!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
</div>

<p>Grandfather gave me for a present a set of books
called &#8220;Irving&#8217;s Catechisms on Ancient Greeks and
Romans.&#8221; They are four little books bound in
leather, which were presented to our mother for a
prize. It is thus inscribed on the front page, &#8220;Miss
Elizabeth Beals at a public examination of the Female
Boarding School in East Bloomfield, October
15, 1825, was judged to excel the school in Reading.
In testimony of which she receives this Premium
from her affectionate instructress, S. Adams.&#8221;</p>

<p>I cannot imagine Grandmother sending us away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>to boarding school, but I suppose she had so many
children then, she could spare one or two as well as
not. She says they sent Aunt Ann to Miss Willard&#8217;s
school at Troy. I received a birthday letter
from Mrs. Beaumont to-day. She wants to know
how everything goes at the Seminary and if Anna
still occupies the front seat in the school room most
of the time. She says she supposes she is quite a
sedate young lady now but she hopes there is a whole
lot of the old Anna left. I think there is.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>December.</i>&mdash;Hon. William H. Lamport went
down to Virginia to see his son and found that he
had just died in the hospital from measles and pneumonia.
Their only son, only eighteen years old!</p>

<p><i>January.</i>&mdash;Grandmother went to Aunt Mary
Carr&#8217;s to tea to-night, very much to our surprise,
for she seldom goes anywhere. Anna said she was
going to keep house exactly as Grandmother did,
so after supper she took a little hot water in a basin
on a tray and got the tea-towels and washed the
silver and best china but she let the ivory handles
on the knives and forks get wet, so I presume they
will all turn black. Grandmother never lets her
little nice things go out into the kitchen, so probably
that is the reason that everything is forty years old
and yet as good as new. She let us have the Young
Ladies&#8217; Aid Society here to supper because I am
President. She came into the parlor and looked
at our basket of work, which the elder ladies cut out
for us to make for the soldiers. She had the supper
table set the whole length of the dining room and
let us preside at the table. Anna made the girls
laugh so, they could hardly eat, although they said
everything was splendid. They said they never ate
better biscuit, preserves, or fruit cake and the coffee
was delicious. After it was over, the &#8220;dear little
lady&#8221; said she hoped we had a good time. After
the girls were gone Grandmother wanted to look
over the garments and see how much we had accomplished
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>and if we had made them well. Mary Field
made a pair of drawers with No. 90 thread. She
said she wanted them to look fine and I am sure
they did. Most of us wrote notes and put inside
the garments for the soldiers in the hospitals.</p>

<p>Sarah Gibson Howell has had an answer to her
letter. His name is Foster&mdash;a Major. She expects
him to come and see her soon.</p>

<p>All the girls wear newspaper bustles to school
now and Anna&#8217;s rattled to-day and Emma Wheeler
heard it and said, &#8220;What&#8217;s the news, Anna?&#8221;
They both laughed out loud and found that &#8220;the
latest news from the front&#8221; was that Miss Morse
kept them both after school and they had to copy
Dictionary for an hour. War prices are terrible.
I paid $3.50 to-day for a hoop skirt.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>January</i> 13.&mdash;P. T. Barnum delivered his lecture
on &#8220;The Art of Money Getting&#8221; in Bemis Hall this
evening for the benefit of the Ladies&#8217; Aid Society,
which is working for the soldiers. We girls went
and enjoyed it.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>February.</i>&mdash;The members of our society sympathized
with General McClellan when he was criticised
by some and we wrote him the following letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p style='text-align:right;'>&#8220;<span class='sc'>Canandaigua</span>, <i>Feb.</i> 13, 1863.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class='sc'>Maj. Gen. Geo. McClellan</span>:</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you pardon any seeming impropriety in our
addressing you, and attribute it to the impulsive love
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>and admiration of hearts which see in you, the bravest
and noblest defender of our Union. We cannot resist
the impulse to tell you, be our words ever so feeble,
how our love and trust have followed you from Rich
Mountain to Antietam, through all slanderous attacks
of traitorous politicians and fanatical defamers&mdash;how
we have admired, not less than your calm courage on
the battlefield, your lofty scorn of those who remained
at home in the base endeavor to strip from your brow
the hard earned laurels placed there by a grateful
country: to tell further, that in your forced retirement
from battlefields of the Republic&#8217;s peril, you have &#8216;but
changed your country&#8217;s arms for more,&mdash;your country&#8217;s
heart,&#8217;&mdash;and to assure you that so long as our
country remains to us a sacred name and our flag
a holy emblem, so long shall we cherish your memory
as the defender and protector of both. We are an
association whose object it is to aid, in the only way
in which woman, alas! can aid our brothers in the
field. Our sympathies are with them in the cause
for which they have periled all&mdash;our hearts are
with them in the prayer, that ere long their beloved
commander may be restored to them, and that once
more as of old he may lead them to victory in the
sacred name of the Union and Constitution.</p>

<p>&#8220;With united prayers that the Father of all may
have you and yours ever in His holy keeping, we
remain your devoted partisans.&#8221;</p>

<p>Signed by a large number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following in reply was addressed to the lady
whose name was first signed to the above:</p>

<blockquote>
<p style='text-align:right;'>&#8220;<span class='sc'>New York</span>, <i>Feb.</i> 21, 1863.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class='sc'>Madam</span>&mdash;I take great pleasure in acknowledging
the receipt of the very kind letter of the 13th inst.,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>from yourself and your friends. Will you do me the
favor to say to them how much I thank them for it,
and that I am at a loss to express my gratitude for
the pleasant and cheering terms in which it is couched.
Such sentiments on the part of those whose brothers
have served with me in the field are more grateful
to me than anything else can be. I feel far more than
rewarded by them for all I have tried to accomplish.&mdash;I am, Madam, with the most sincere respect and
friendship, yours very truly,</p>

<p style='text-align:right;'><span class='sc'>Geo. B. McClellan.</span>&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>May.</i>&mdash;A number of the teachers and pupils of the
Academy have enlisted for the war. Among them
E. C. Clarke, H. C. Kirk, A. T. Wilder, Norman K.
Martin, T. C. Parkhurst, Mr. Gates. They have a
tent on the square and are enlisting men in Canandaigua
and vicinity for the 4th N. Y. Heavy Artillery.
I received a letter from Mr. Noah T.
Clarke&#8217;s mother in Naples. She had already sent
three sons, Bela, William and Joseph, to the war and
she is very sad because her youngest has now enlisted.
She says she feels as did Jacob of old when
he said, &#8220;I am bereaved of my children. Joseph
is not and Simeon is not and now you will take
Benjamin away.&#8221; I have heard that she is a beautiful
singer but she says she cannot sing any more
until this cruel war is over. I wish that I could
write something to comfort her but I feel as Mrs.
Browning puts it: &#8220;If you want a song for your
Italy free, let none look at me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>Our society met at Fannie Pierce&#8217;s this afternoon.
Her mother is an invalid and never gets out at all,
but she is very much interested in the soldiers and
in all young people, and loves to have us come in
and see her and we love to go. She enters into the
plans of all of us young girls and has a personal
interest in us. We had a very good time to-night
and Laura Chapin was more full of fun than usual.
Once there was silence for a minute or two and
some one said, &#8220;awful pause.&#8221; Laura said, &#8220;I
guess you would have awful paws if you worked as
hard as I do.&#8221; We were talking about how many
of us girls would be entitled to flag bed quilts, and
according to the rules, they said that, up to date,
Abbie Clark and I were the only ones. The explanation
is that Captain George N. Williams and
Lieutenant E. C. Clarke are enlisted in their country&#8217;s
service. Susie Daggett is Secretary and
Treasurer of the Society and she reported that in
one year&#8217;s time we made in our society 133 pairs of
drawers, 101 shirts, 4 pairs socks for soldiers, and
54 garments for the families of soldiers.</p>

<p>Abbie Clark and I had our ambrotypes taken to-day
for two young braves who are going to the war.
William H. Adams is also commissioned Captain
and is going to the front.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>July</i> 4.&mdash;The terrible battle of Gettysburg brings
to Canandaigua sad news of our soldier boys of the
126th Regiment. Colonel Sherrill was instantly
killed, also Captains Wheeler and Herendeen,
Henry Willson and Henry P. Cook. Captain Richardson
was wounded.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span><i>July</i> 26.&mdash;Charlie Wheeler was buried with military
honors from the Congregational church to-day.
Two companies of the 54th New York State National
Guard attended the funeral, and the church
was packed, galleries and all. It was the saddest
funeral and the only one of a soldier that I ever
attended. I hope it will be the last. He was killed
at Gettysburg, July 3, by a sharpshooter&#8217;s bullet.
He was a very bright young man, graduate of Yale
college and was practising law. He was captain of
Company K, 126th N. Y. Volunteers. I have
copied an extract from Mr. Morse&#8217;s lecture, &#8220;You
and I&#8221;: &#8220;And who has forgotten that gifted
youth, who fell on the memorable field of Gettysburg?
To win a noble name, to save a beloved
country, he took his place beneath the dear old flag,
and while cannon thundered and sabers clashed and
the stars of the old Union shone above his head he
went down in the shock of battle and left us desolate,
a name to love and a glory to endure. And as
we solemnly know, as by the old charter of liberty
we most sacredly swear, he was truly and faithfully
and religiously</p>

<p>These were patriots, these were our jewels.
When shall we see their like again?  And of every
soldier who has fallen in this war his friends may
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>write just as lovingly as you and I may do of those
to whom I pay my feeble tribute.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>August,</i> 1863.&mdash;The U. S. Sanitary Commission
has been organized. Canandaigua sent Dr. W. Fitch
Cheney to Gettysburg with supplies for the sick and
wounded and he took seven assistants with him.
Home bounty was brought to the tents and put into
the hands of the wounded soldiers. A blessed work.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>August</i> 12.&mdash;Lucilla Field was married in our
church to-day to Rev. S. W. Pratt. I always
thought she was cut out for a minister&#8217;s wife.
Jennie Draper cried herself sick because Lucilla,
her Sunday School teacher, is going away.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>October</i> 8.&mdash;News came to-day of the death of
Lieutenant Hiram Brown. He died of fever at
Portsmouth, only little more than a year after he
went away.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>November</i> 1.&mdash;The 4th New York Heavy Artillery
is stationed at Fort Hamilton, N. Y. harbor.
Uncle Edward has invited me down to New York
to spend a month! Very opportune! Grandfather
says that I can go and Miss Rosewarne is beginning
a new dress for me to-day.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>November</i> 6.&mdash;We were saddened to-day by news
of the death of Augustus Torrey Wilder in the hospital
at Fort Ethan Allen.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span><i>November</i> 9.&mdash;No. 68 E. 19th Street, New York
City. Grandfather and I came from Canandaigua
yesterday. He is at Gramercy Park Hotel. We
were met by a military escort of &#8220;one&#8221; at Albany
and consequently came through more safely, I suppose.
James met us at 42d Street Grand Central
Station. He lives at Uncle Edward&#8217;s; attends to
all of his legal business and is his confidential clerk.
I like it very much here. They are very stylish and
grand but I don&#8217;t mind that. Aunt Emily is reserved
and dignified but very kind. People do not
pour their tea or coffee into their saucers any more
to cool it, but drink it from the cup, and you must
mind and not leave your teaspoon in your cup. I
notice everything and am very particular. Mr.
Morris K. Jesup lives right across the street and I
see him every day, as he is a friend of Uncle Edward.
Grandfather has gone back home and left
me in charge of friends &#8220;a la militaire&#8221; and others.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>November</i> 15.&mdash;&#8220;We&#8221; went out to Fort Hamilton
to-day and are going to Blackwell&#8217;s Island to-morrow
and to many other places of interest down
the Bay. Soldiers are everywhere and I feel quite
important, walking around in company with blue
coat and brass buttons&mdash;very becoming style of
dress for men and the military salute at every turn
is what one reads about.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday</i>.&mdash;Went to Broadway Tabernacle to
church to-day and heard Rev. Joseph P. Thompson
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>preach. Abbie Clark is visiting her sister, Mrs.
Fred Thompson, and sat a few seats ahead of us in
church. She turned around and saw us. We also
saw Henrietta Francis Talcott, who was a &#8220;Seminary
girl.&#8221; She wants me to come to see her in
her New York home.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>November</i> 19.&mdash;We wish we were at Gettysburg
to-day to hear President Lincoln&#8217;s and Edward Everett&#8217;s
addresses at the dedication of the National
Cemetery. We will read them in to-morrow&#8217;s papers,
but it will not be like hearing them.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Author&#8217;s Note,</i> 1911.&mdash;Forty-eight years have
elapsed since Lincoln&#8217;s speech was delivered at the
dedication of the Soldiers&#8217; Cemetery at Gettysburg.
So eloquent and remarkable was his utterance that I
believe I am correct in stating that every word
spoken has now been translated into all known languages
and is regarded as one of the World Classics.
The same may be said of Lincoln&#8217;s letter to the
mother of five sons lost in battle. I make no apology
for inserting in this place both the speech and the
letter. Mr. Whitelaw Reid, the American Ambassador
to Great Britain, in an address on Lincoln delivered
at the University of Birmingham in December,
1910, remarked in reference to this letter,
&#8220;What classic author in our common English
tongue has surpassed that?&#8221; and next may I ask,
&#8220;What English or American orator has on a similar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>occasion surpassed this address on the battlefield of
Gettysburg?&#8221;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Four score and seven years ago, our fathers
brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived
in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that
all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in
a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any
nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.
We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We
have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a
final resting place for those who gave their lives that
that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and
proper that we should do this. But in a larger sense
we cannot dedicate&mdash;we cannot consecrate&mdash;we cannot
hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead,
who struggled here have consecrated it far above our
poor power to add or detract. The world will little
note, nor long remember, what we say here&mdash;but it
can never forget what they did here. It is for us,
the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished
work which they who fought here have thus
far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here
dedicated to the great task remaining before us&mdash;that
from these honored dead we take increased devotion
to that cause for which they gave the last full measure
of devotion&mdash;that we here highly resolve, that these
dead shall not have died in vain&mdash;that this nation
under God shall have a new birth of freedom&mdash;and
that government of the people, by the people and for
the people, shall not perish from the earth.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was during the dark days of the war that he
wrote this simple letter of sympathy to a bereaved
mother:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I have been shown, in the files of the War
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>Department, a statement that you are the mother of
five sons who have died gloriously on the field of
battle. I feel how weak and fruitless must be any
words of mine which should attempt to beguile you
from your grief for a loss so overwhelming, but I
cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation
which may be found in the thanks of the Republic
they died to save. I pray that our Heavenly Father
may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and
leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and
lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours, to have
laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of Freedom.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>November</i> 21.&mdash;Abbie Clark and her cousin Cora
came to call and invited me and her soldier cousin
to come to dinner to-night, at Mrs. Thompson&#8217;s.
He will be here this afternoon and I will give him
the invitation. James is asked for the evening.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>November</i> 22.&mdash;We had a delightful visit. Mr.
Thompson took us up into his den and showed us
curios from all over the world and as many pictures
as we would find in an art gallery.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;Last evening Uncle Edward took a
party of us, including Abbie Clark, to Wallack&#8217;s
Theater to see &#8220;Rosedale,&#8221; which is having a great
run. I enjoyed it and told James it was the best
play I ever &#8220;heard.&#8221;  He said I must not say that
I &#8220;heard&#8221; a play. I &#8220;saw&#8221; it. I stand corrected.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>I told James that I heard of a young girl who
went abroad and on her return some one asked her
if she saw King Lear and she said, no, he was sick
all the time she was there! I just loved the play
last night and laughed and cried in turn, it seemed
so real. I don&#8217;t know what Grandmother will say,
but I wrote her about it and said, &#8220;When you are
with the Romans, you must do as the Romans do.&#8221;
I presume she will say &#8220;that is not the way you were
brought up.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>December</i> 7.&mdash;The 4th New York Heavy Artillery
has orders to move to Fort Ethan Allen, near
Washington, and I have orders to return to Canandaigua.
I have enjoyed the five weeks very much
and as &#8220;the soldier&#8221; was on parole most of the time
I have seen much of interest in the city. Uncle
Edward says that he has lived here forty years but
has never visited some of the places that we have
seen, so he told me when I mentioned climbing to
the top of Trinity steeple.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='sc'>Canandaigua</span>, <i>December</i> 8.&mdash;Home again. I
had military attendance as far as Paterson, N. J.,
and came the rest of the way with strangers. Not
caring to talk I liked it just as well. When I said
good bye I could not help wondering whether it
was for years, or forever. This cruel war is terrible
and precious lives are being sacrificed and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>hearts broken every day. What is to be the result?
We can only trust and wait.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Christmas Eve,</i> 1863.&mdash;Sarah Gibson Howell was
married to Major Foster this evening. She invited
all the society and many others. It was a beautiful
wedding and we all enjoyed it. Some time ago I
asked her to write in my album and she sewed a
lock of her black curling hair on the page and in the
center of it wrote, &#8220;Forget not Gippie.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>December</i> 31.&mdash;Our brother John was married in
Boston to-day to Laura Arnold, a lovely girl.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 1.&mdash;Grandfather had decided to go to New
York to attend the fair given by the Sanitary Commission,
and he is taking two immense books, which
are more than one hundred years old, to present to
the Commission, for the benefit of the war fund.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>April</i> 18.&mdash;Grandfather returned home to-day,
unexpectedly to us. I knew he was sick when I
met him at the door. He had traveled all night
alone from New York, although he said that a
stranger, a fellow passenger, from Ann Arbor,
Mich., on the train noticed that he was suffering and
was very kind to him. He said he fell in his room
at Gramercy Park Hotel in the night, and his knee
was very painful. We sent for old Dr. Cheney and
he said the hurt was a serious one and needed most
careful attention. I was invited to a spelling school
at Abbie Clark&#8217;s in the evening and Grandmother
said that she and Anna would take care of Grandfather
till I got back, and then I could sit up by
him the rest of the night. We spelled down and
had quite a merry time. Major C. S. Aldrich had
escaped from prison and was there. He came home
with me, as my soldier is down in Virginia.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span><i>April</i> 19.&mdash;Grandfather is much worse. He was
delirious all night. We have sent for Dr. Rosewarne
in counsel and Mrs. Lightfoote has come to
stay with us all the time and we have sent for Aunt
Glorianna.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>April</i> 20.&mdash;Grandfather dictated a letter to-night
to a friend of his in New York. After I had finished
he asked me if I had mended his gloves. I
said no, but I would have them ready when he
wanted them. Dear Grandfather! he looks so sick
I fear he will never wear his gloves again.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>May</i> 16.&mdash;I have not written in my diary for a
month and it has been the saddest month of my life.
Dear, dear Grandfather is dead. He was buried
May 2, just two weeks from the day that he returned
from New York. We did everything for him that
could be done, but at the end of the first week the
doctors saw that he was beyond all human aid.
Uncle Thomas told the doctors that they must tell
him. He was much surprised but received the verdict
calmly. He said &#8220;he had no notes out and
perhaps it was the best time to go.&#8221; He had taught
us how to live and he seemed determined to show
us how a Christian should die. He said he wanted
&#8220;Grandmother and the children to come to him and
have all the rest remain outside.&#8221; When we came
into the room he said to Grandmother, &#8220;Do you
know what the doctors say?&#8221; She bowed her head,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>and then he motioned for her to come on one side
and Anna and me on the other and kneel by his bedside.
He placed a hand upon us and upon her and
said to her, &#8220;All the rest seem very much excited,
but you and I must be composed.&#8221; Then he asked
us to say the 23d Psalm, &#8220;The Lord is my Shepherd,&#8221;
and then all of us said the Lord&#8217;s Prayer
together after Grandmother had offered a little
prayer for grace and strength in this trying hour.
Then he said, &#8220;Grandmother, you must take care of
the girls, and, girls, you must take care of Grandmother.&#8221;
We felt as though our hearts would
break and were sure we never could be happy again.
During the next few days he often spoke of dying
and of what we must do when he was gone. Once
when I was sitting by him he looked up and smiled
and said, &#8220;You will lose all your roses watching
over me.&#8221; A good many business men came in to
see him to receive his parting blessing. The two
McKechnie brothers, Alexander and James, came in
together on their way home from church the Sunday
before he died. Dr. Daggett came very often. Mr.
Alexander Howell and Mrs. Worthington came, too.</p>

<p>He lived until Saturday, the 30th, and in the
morning he said, &#8220;Open the door wide.&#8221; We did
so and he said, &#8220;Let the King of Glory enter in.&#8221;
Very soon after he said, &#8220;I am going home to
Paradise,&#8221; and then sank into that sleep which on
this earth knows no waking. I sat by the window
near his bed and watched the rain beat into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>grass and saw the peonies and crocuses and daffodils
beginning to come up out of the ground and I
thought to myself, I shall never see the flowers come
up again without thinking of these sad, sad days.
He was buried Monday afternoon, May 2, from the
Congregational church, and Dr. Daggett preached
a sermon from a favorite text of Grandfather&#8217;s, &#8220;I
shall die in my nest.&#8221; James and John came and
as we stood with dear Grandmother and all the
others around his open grave and heard Dr. Daggett
say in his beautiful sympathetic voice, &#8220;Earth to
earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust,&#8221; we felt that
we were losing our best friend; but he told us
that we must live for Grandmother and so we
will.</p>

<p>The next Sabbath, Anna and I were called out of
church by a messenger, who said that Grandmother
was taken suddenly ill and was dying. When we
reached the house attendants were all about her
administering restoratives, but told us she was rapidly
sinking. I asked if I might speak to her and
was reluctantly permitted, as they thought best not
to disturb her. I sat down by her and with tearful
voice said, &#8220;Grandmother, don&#8217;t you know that
Grandfather said we were to care for you and you
were to care for us and if you die we cannot do as
Grandfather said?&#8221; She opened her eyes and
looked at me and said quietly, &#8220;Dry your eyes, child,
I shall not die to-day or to-morrow.&#8221; She seems
well now.</p>

<p style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'><span class='b'>In Memoriam</span></p>

<p>Thomas Beals died in Canandaigua, N. Y., on
Saturday, April 30th, 1864, in the 81st year of his
age. Mr. Beals was born in Boston, Mass., November
13, 1783.</p>

<p>He came to this village in October, 1803, only
14 years after the first settlement of the place. He
was married in March, 1805, to Abigail Field, sister
of the first pastor of the Congregational church
here. Her family, in several of its branches, have
since been distinguished in the ministry, the legal
profession, and in commercial enterprise.</p>

<p>Living to a good old age, and well known as one
of our most wealthy and respected citizens, Mr.
Beals is another added to the many examples of successful
men who, by energy and industry, have made
their own fortune.</p>

<p>On coming to this village, he was teacher in the
Academy for a time, and afterward entered into
mercantile business, in which he had his share of
vicissitude. When the Ontario Savings Bank was
established, 1832, he became the Treasurer, and
managed it successfully till the institution ceased, in
1835, with his withdrawal. In the meantime he
conducted, also, a banking business of his own, and
this was continued until a week previous to his
death, when he formally withdrew, though for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>last five years devolving its more active duties upon
his son.</p>

<p>As a banker, his sagacity and fidelity won for
him the confidence and respect of all classes of persons
in this community. The business portion of
our village is very much indebted to his enterprise
for the eligible structures he built that have more
than made good the losses sustained by fires. More
than fifty years ago he was actively concerned in the
building of the Congregational church, and also
superintended the erection of the county jail and
almshouse; for many years a trustee of Canandaigua
Academy, and trustee and treasurer of the
Congregational church. At the time of his death
he and his wife, who survives him, were the oldest
members of the church, having united with it in
1807, only eight years after its organization. Until
hindered by the infirmities of age, he was a constant
attendant of its services and ever devoutly maintained
the worship of God in his family. No person
has been more generally known among all classes
of our citizens. Whether at home or abroad he
could not fail to be remarked for his gravity and
dignity. His character was original, independent,
and his manners remarkable for a dignified courtesy.
Our citizens were familiar with his brief, emphatic
answers with the wave of his hand. He was fond
of books, a great reader, collected a valuable number
of volumes, and was happy in the use of language
both in writing and conversation. In many unusual
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>ways he often showed his kind consideration for the
poor and afflicted, and many persons hearing of his
death gratefully recollect instances, not known to
others, of his seasonable kindness to them in trouble.
In his charities he often studied concealment
as carefully as others court display. His marked
individuality of character and deportment, together
with his shrewd discernment and active habits,
could not fail to leave a distinct impression on the
minds of all.</p>

<p>For more than sixty years he transacted business
in one place here, and his long life thus teaches more
than one generation the value of sobriety, diligence,
fidelity and usefulness.</p>

<p>In his last illness he remarked to a friend that he
always loved Canandaigua; had done several things
for its prosperity, and had intended to do more.
He had known his measure of affliction; only four
of eleven children survive him, but children and children&#8217;s
children ministered to the comfort of his last
days. Notwithstanding his years and infirmities,
he was able to visit New York, returning April 18th
quite unwell, but not immediately expecting a fatal
termination. As the final event drew near, he
seemed happily prepared to meet it. He conversed
freely with his friends and neighbors in a softened
and benignant spirit, at once receiving and imparting
benedictions. His end seemed to realize his
favorite citation from Job: &#8220;I shall die in my
nest.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>His funeral was attended on Monday in the Congregational
church by a large assembly, Dr. Daggett,
the pastor, officiating on the occasion.&mdash;Written
by Dr. O. E. Daggett in 1864.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>May.</i>&mdash;The 4th New York Heavy Artillery is
having hard times in the Virginia mud and rain.
They are near Culpeper. It is such a change from
their snug winter quarters at Fort Ethan Allen.
There are 2,800 men in the Regiment and 1,200 are
sick. Dr. Charles S. Hoyt of the 126th, which is
camping close by, has come to the help of these new
recruits so kindly as to win every heart, quite in
contrast to the heartlessness of their own surgeons.
They will always love him for this. It is just like
him.</p>

June 16, and was valedictorian of her class. There
were eleven girls in the class, Ritie Tyler, Mary
Antes, Jennie Robinson, Hattie Paddock, Lillie

and Miss Palmer, Miss Jasper and Anna. The subject
of her essay was &#8220;The Last Time.&#8221; I will
copy an account of the exercises as they appeared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>in this week&#8217;s village paper. Every one thinks it
was written by Mr. E. M. Morse.</p>

<p style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>A WORD FROM AN OLD MAN</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<span class='sc'>Mr. Editor</span>:</p>

<p>&#8220;Less than a century ago I was traveling through
this enchanted region and accidentally heard that it
was commencement week at the seminary. I went.
My venerable appearance seemed to command respect
and I received many attentions. I presented my snowy
head and patriarchal beard at the doors of the sacred
institution and was admitted. I heard all the classes,
primary, secondary, tertiary, et cetera. All went
merry as a marriage bell. Thursday was the great
day. I made vast preparation. I rose early, dressed
with much care. I affectionately pressed the hands
of my two landlords and left. When I arrived at
the seminary I saw at a glance that it was a place
where true merit was appreciated. I was invited to
a seat among the dignitaries, but declined. I am a
modest man, I always was. I recognized the benign
Principals of the school. You can find no better principles
in the states than in Ontario Female Seminary.
After the report of the committee a very lovely young
lady arose and saluted us in Latin. I looked very
wise, I always do. So did everybody. We all understood
it. As she proceeded, I thought the grand old
Roman tongue had never sounded so musically and
when she pronounced the decree, &#8216;Richmond delenda
est,&#8217; we all hoped it might be prophetic. Then followed
the essays of the other young ladies and then
every one waited anxiously for &#8216;The Last Time.&#8217;
At last it came. The story was beautifully told, the
adieux were tenderly spoken. We saw the withered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>flowers of early years scattered along the academic
ways, and the golden fruit of scholarly culture ripening
in the gardens of the future. Enchanted by the
sorrowful eloquence, bewildered by the melancholy
brilliancy, I sent a rosebud to the charming valedictorian
and wandered out into the grounds. I went
to the concert in the evening and was pleased and
delighted. So was everybody. I shall return next
year unless the gout carries me off. I hope I shall
hear just such beautiful music, see just such beautiful
faces and dine at the same excellent hotel.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>July</i> 10.&mdash;We have had word of the death of
Spencer F. Lincoln. One more brave soldier sacrificed.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>August.</i>&mdash;The New York State S. S. Convention
was held in Buffalo and among others Fanny Gaylord,
Mary Field and myself attended. We had a
fine time and were entertained at the home of Mr.
and Mrs. Sexton. Her mother is living with her,
a dear old lady who was Judge Atwater&#8217;s daughter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>and used to go to school to Grandfather Beals. We
went with other delegates on an excursion to
Niagara Falls and went into the express office at the
R. R. station to see Grant Schley, who is express
agent there. He said it seemed good to see so many
home faces.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>September</i> 1.&mdash;My war letters come from Georgetown
Hospital now. Mr. Noah T. Clarke is very
anxious and sends telegrams to Andrew Chesebro
every day to go and see his brother.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>September</i> 30.&mdash;To-day the &#8220;Benjamin&#8221; of the
family reached home under the care of Dr. J. Byron
Hayes, who was sent to Washington after him. I
went over to Mr. Noah T. Clarke&#8217;s to see him and
found him just a shadow of his former self. However,
&#8220;hope springs eternal in the human breast&#8221;
and he says he knows he will soon be well again.
This is his thirtieth birthday and it is glorious that
he can spend it at home.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>October</i> 1.&mdash;Mr. Noah T. Clarke accompanied
his brother to-day to the old home in Naples and
found two other soldier brothers, William and Joseph,
had just arrived on leave of absence from the
army so the mother&#8217;s heart sang &#8220;Praise God from
whom all blessings flow.&#8221; The fourth brother has
also returned to his home in Illinois, disabled.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span><i>November.</i>&mdash;They are holding Union Revival
Services in town now. One evangelist from out of
town said he would call personally at the homes and
ask if all were Christians. Anna told Grandmother
if he came here she should tell him about her.
Grandmother said we must each give an account
for ourselves. Anna said she should tell him about
her little Grandmother anyway. We saw him coming
up the walk about 11 <span class='sc'>a.m.</span> and Anna went to
the door and asked him in. They sat down in the
parlor and he remarked about the pleasant weather
and Canandaigua such a beautiful town and the people
so cultured. She said yes, she found the town
every way desirable and the people pleasant, though
she had heard it remarked that strangers found it
hard to get acquainted and that you had to have
a residence above the R. R. track and give a satisfactory
answer as to who your Grandfather was,
before admittance was granted to the best society.
He said he had been kindly received everywhere.
She said &#8220;everybody likes ministers.&#8221; (He was
quite handsome and young.) He asked her how
long she had lived here and she told him nearly all
of her brief existence! She said if he had asked
her how old she was she would have told him she
was so young that Will Adams last May was appointed
her guardian. He asked how many there
were in the family and she said her Grandmother,
her sister and herself. He said, &#8220;They are Christians,
I suppose.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;my sister is a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>S. S. teacher and my Grandmother was born a
Christian, about 80 years ago.&#8221; &#8220;Indeed,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I would like to see her.&#8221; Anna said she would
have to be excused as she seldom saw company.
When he arose to go he said, &#8220;My dear young lady,
I trust that you are a Christian.&#8221; &#8220;Mercy yes,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;years ago.&#8221; He said he was very glad
and hoped she would let her light shine. She said
that was what she was always doing&mdash;that the other
night at a revival meeting she sang every verse of
every hymn and came home feeling as though she
had herself personally rescued by hand at least fifty
&#8220;from sin and the grave.&#8221; He smiled approvingly
and bade her good bye. She told Grandmother she
presumed he would say &#8220;he had not found so great
faith, no not in Israel.&#8221;</p>

<p>We have Teachers&#8217; meetings now and Mrs.
George Wilson leads and instructs us on the Sunday
School lesson for the following Sunday. We met
at Mrs. Worthington&#8217;s this evening. I think Mrs.

the Westminster Catechism and the Bible from beginning
to end.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 5.&mdash;I have just read President Lincoln&#8217;s
second inaugural address. It only takes five minutes
to read it but, oh, how much it contains.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>March</i> 20.&mdash;Hardly a day passes that we do not
hear news of Union victories. Every one predicts
that the war is nearly at an end.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>March</i> 29.&mdash;An officer arrived here from the
front yesterday and he said that, on Saturday morning,
shortly after the battle commenced which resulted
so gloriously for the Union in front of Petersburg,
President Lincoln, accompanied by General
Grant and staff, started for the battlefield, and
reached there in time to witness the close of the
contest and the bringing in of the prisoners. His
presence was immediately recognized and created
the most intense enthusiasm. He afterwards rode
over the battlefield, listened to the report of General
Parke to General Grant, and added his thanks for
the great service rendered in checking the onslaught
of the rebels and in capturing so many of their number.
I read this morning the order of Secretary
Stanton for the flag raising on Fort Sumter. It
reads thus: &#8220;War department, Adjutant General&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>office, Washington, March 27th, 1865, General Orders
No. 50. Ordered, first: That at the hour of
noon, on the 14th day of April, 1865, Brevet Major
General Anderson will raise and plant upon the
ruins of Fort Sumter, in Charleston Harbor, the
same U. S. Flag which floated over the battlements
of this fort during the rebel assault, and which was
lowered and saluted by him and the small force of
his command when the works were evacuated on the
14th day of April, 1861. Second, That the flag,
when raised be saluted by 100 guns from Fort Sumter
and by a national salute from every fort and
rebel battery that fired upon Fort Sumter. Third,
That suitable ceremonies be had upon the occasion,
under the direction of Major-General William T.
Sherman, whose military operations compelled the
rebels to evacuate Charleston, or, in his absence,
under the charge of Major-General Q. A. Gillmore,
commanding the department. Among the ceremonies
will be the delivery of a public address by the
Rev. Henry Ward Beecher. Fourth, That the naval
forces at Charleston and their Commander on that
station be invited to participate in the ceremonies
of the occasion. By order of the President of the
United States. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of
War.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>April,</i> 1865.&mdash;What a month this has been. On
the 6th of April Governor Fenton issued this proclamation:
&#8220;Richmond has fallen. The wicked men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>who governed the so-called Confederate States have
fled their capital, shorn of their power and influence.
The rebel armies have been defeated, broken and
scattered. Victory everywhere attends our banners
and our armies, and we are rapidly moving to
the closing scenes of the war. Through the self-sacrifice
and heroic devotion of our soldiers, the
life of the republic has been saved and the American
Union preserved. I, Reuben E. Fenton, Governor
of the State of New York, do designate Friday, the
14th of April, the day appointed for the ceremony
of raising the United States flag on Fort
Sumter, as a day of Thanksgiving, prayer and praise
to Almighty God, for the signal blessings we have
received at His hands.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Saturday, April</i> 8.&mdash;The cannon has fired a salute
of thirty-six guns to celebrate the fall of Richmond.
This evening the streets were thronged with men,
women and children all acting crazy as if they had
not the remotest idea where they were or what they
were doing. Atwater block was beautifully lighted
and the band was playing in front of it. On the
square they fired guns, and bonfires were lighted in
the streets. Gov. Clark&#8217;s house was lighted from
the very garret and they had a transparency in front,
with &#8220;Richmond&#8221; on it, which Fred Thompson
made. We didn&#8217;t even light &#8220;our other candle,&#8221;
for Grandmother said she preferred to keep Saturday
night and pity and pray for the poor suffering,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>wounded soldiers, who are so apt to be forgotten in
the hour of victory.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday Evening, April</i> 9.&mdash;There were great
crowds at church this morning. Dr. Daggett&#8217;s text
was from Prov. 18: 10: &#8220;The name of the Lord
is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it,
and is safe.&#8221; It was a very fine sermon. They
sang hymns relating to our country and Dr. Daggett&#8217;s
prayers were full of thanksgiving. Mr. Noah
T. Clarke had the chapel decorated with flags and
opened the Sunday School by singing, &#8220;Marching
On,&#8221; &#8220;My Country, &#8217;tis of Thee,&#8221; &#8220;The Star
Spangled Banner,&#8221; &#8220;Glory, Hallelujah,&#8221; etc. Hon.
Wm. H. Lamport talked very pleasantly and paid a
very touching tribute to the memory of the boys,
who had gone out to defend their country, who
would never come &#8220;marching home again.&#8221; He
lost his only son, 18 years old (in the 126th), about
two years ago. I sat near Mary and Emma
Wheeler and felt so sorry for them. They could
not sing.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Monday Morning, April</i> 10.&mdash;&#8220;Whether I am in
the body, or out of the body, I know not, but one
thing I know,&#8221; Lee has surrendered! and all the
people seem crazy in consequence. The bells are
ringing, boys and girls, men and women are running
through the streets wild with excitement; the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>flags are all flying, one from the top of our church,
and such a &#8220;hurrah boys&#8221; generally, I never
dreamed of. We were quietly eating our breakfast
this morning about 7 o&#8217;clock, when our church bell
commenced to ring, then the Methodist bell, and now
all the bells in town are ringing. Mr. Noah T.
Clarke ran by, all excitement, and I don&#8217;t believe
he knows where he is. No school to-day. I saw
Capt. Aldrich passing, so I rushed to the window
and he waved his hat. I raised the window
and asked him what was the matter? He came to
the front door where I met him and he almost shook
my hand off and said, &#8220;The war is over. We have
Lee&#8217;s surrender, with his own name signed.&#8221; I am
going down town now, to see for myself, what is
going on. Later&mdash;I have returned and I never saw
such performances in my life. Every man has a
bell or a horn, and every girl a flag and a little bell,
and every one is tied with red, white and blue ribbons.
I am going down town again now, with my
flag in one hand and bell in the other and make all
the noise I can. Mr. Noah T. Clarke and other
leading citizens are riding around on a dray cart
with great bells in their hands ringing them as hard
as they can. Dr. Cook beat upon an old gong.
The latest musical instrument invented is called the
&#8220;Jerusalem fiddle.&#8221; Some boys put a dry goods
box upon a cart, put some rosin on the edge of the
box and pulled a piece of timber back and forth
across it, making most unearthly sounds. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>drove through all the streets, Ed Lampman riding
on the horse and driving it.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Monday evening, April</i> 10.&mdash;I have been out
walking for the last hour and a half, looking at the
brilliant illuminations, transparencies and everything
else and I don&#8217;t believe I was ever so tired in
my life. The bells have not stopped ringing more
than five minutes all day and every one is glad to
see Canandaigua startled out of its propriety for
once. Every yard of red, white and blue ribbon in
the stores has been sold, also every candle and every
flag. One society worked hard all the afternoon
making transparencies and then there were no candles
to put in to light them, but they will be ready
for the next celebration when peace is proclaimed.
The Court House, Atwater Block, and hotel have
about two dozen candles in each window throughout,
besides flags and mottoes of every description. It
is certainly the best impromptu display ever gotten
up in this town. &#8220;Victory is Grant-ed,&#8221; is in large
red, white and blue letters in front of Atwater
Block. The speeches on the square this morning
were all very good. Dr. Daggett commenced with
prayer, and such a prayer, I wish all could have
heard it. Hon. Francis Granger, E. G. Lapham,
Judge Smith, Alexander Howell, Noah T. Clarke
and others made speeches and we sang &#8220;Old Hundred&#8221;
in conclusion, and Rev. Dr. Hibbard dismissed
us with the benediction. I shook hands with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>Mr. Noah T. Clarke, but he told me to be careful and
not hurt him, for he blistered his hands to-day ringing
that bell. He says he is going to keep the bell
for his grandchildren. Between the speeches on the
square this morning a song was called for and Gus
Coleman mounted the steps and started &#8220;John
Brown&#8221; and all the assembly joined in the chorus,
&#8220;Glory, Hallelujah.&#8221; This has been a never to be
forgotten day.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>April</i> 15.&mdash;The news came this morning that our
dear president, Abraham Lincoln, was assassinated
yesterday, on the day appointed for thanksgiving
for Union victories. I have felt sick over it all day
and so has every one that I have seen. All seem
to feel as though they had lost a personal friend,
and tears flow plenteously. How soon has sorrow
followed upon the heels of joy! One week ago to-night
we were celebrating our victories with loud
acclamations of mirth and good cheer. Now every
one is silent and sad and the earth and heavens seem
clothed in sack-cloth. The bells have been tolling
this afternoon. The flags are all at half mast,
draped with mourning, and on every store and
dwelling-house some sign of the nation&#8217;s loss is
visible. Just after breakfast this morning, I looked
out of the window and saw a group of men listening
to the reading of a morning paper, and I feared
from their silent, motionless interest that something
dreadful had happened, but I was not prepared to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>hear of the cowardly murder of our President.
And William H. Seward, too, I suppose cannot survive
his wounds. Oh, how horrible it is! I went
down town shortly after I heard the news, and it
was wonderful to see the effect of the intelligence
upon everybody, small or great, rich or poor.
Every one was talking low, with sad and anxious
looks. But we know that God still reigns and will
do what is best for us all. Perhaps we&#8217;re &#8220;putting
our trust too much in princes,&#8221; forgetting the Great
Ruler, who alone can create or destroy, and therefore
He has taken from us the arm of flesh that
we may lean more confidingly and entirely upon
Him. I trust that the men who committed
these foul deeds will soon be brought to justice.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday, Easter Day, April</i> 16.&mdash;I went to church
this morning. The pulpit and choir-loft were covered
with flags festooned with crape. Although a
very disagreeable day, the house was well filled.
The first hymn sung was &#8220;Oh God our help in ages
past, our hope for years to come.&#8221; Dr. Daggett&#8217;s
prayer, I can never forget, he alluded so beautifully
to the nation&#8217;s loss, and prayed so fervently that the
God of our fathers might still be our God, through
every calamity or affliction, however severe or mysterious.
All seemed as deeply affected as though
each one had been suddenly bereft of his best
friend. The hymn sung after the prayer, commenced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>with &#8220;Yes, the Redeemer rose.&#8221; Dr. Daggett
said that he had intended to preach a sermon
upon the resurrection. He read the psalm beginning,
&#8220;Lord, Thou hast been our dwelling-place in
all generations.&#8221; His text was &#8220;That our faith
and hope might be in God.&#8221; He commenced by
saying, &#8220;I feel as you feel this morning: our sad
hearts have all throbbed in unison since yesterday
morning when the telegram announced to us Abraham
Lincoln is shot.&#8221; He said the last week would
never be forgotten, for never had any of us seen
one come in with so much joy, that went out with
so much sorrow. His whole sermon related to the
President&#8217;s life and death, and, in conclusion, he
exhorted us not to be despondent, for he was confident
that the ship of state would not go down,
though the helmsman had suddenly been taken away
while the promised land was almost in view. He
prayed for our new President, that he might be filled
with grace and power from on High, to perform
his high and holy trust. On Thursday we are to
have a union meeting in our church, but it will not
be the day of general rejoicing and thanksgiving we
expected. All noisy demonstrations will be omitted.
In Sunday school the desk was draped with mourning,
and the flag at half-mast was also festooned
with crape. Mr. Noah T. Clarke opened the exercises
with the hymn &#8220;He leadeth me,&#8221; followed by
&#8220;Though the days are dark with sorrow,&#8221; &#8220;We
know not what&#8217;s before us,&#8221; &#8220;My days are gliding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>swiftly by.&#8221; Then, Mr. Clarke said that we always
meant to sing &#8220;America,&#8221; after every victory, and
last Monday he was wondering if we would not
have to sing it twice to-day, or add another verse,
but our feelings have changed since then. Nevertheless
he thought we had better sing &#8220;America,&#8221;
for we certainly ought to love our country more
than ever, now that another, and such another, martyr,
had given up his life for it. So we sang it.
Then he talked to the children and said that last
Friday was supposed to be the anniversary of the
day upon which our Lord was crucified, and though,
at the time the dreadful deed was committed, every
one felt the day to be the darkest one the earth
ever knew; yet since then, the day has been called
&#8220;Good Friday,&#8221; for it was the death of Christ
which gave life everlasting to all the people. So he
thought that life would soon come out of darkness,
which now overshadows us all, and that the
death of Abraham Lincoln might yet prove
the nation&#8217;s life in God&#8217;s own most mysterious
way.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Wednesday evening, April</i> 19, 1865.&mdash;This being
the day set for the funeral of Abraham Lincoln at
Washington, it was decided to hold the service to-day,
instead of Thursday, as previously announced
in the Congregational church. All places of business
were closed and the bells of the village churches
tolled from half past ten till eleven o&#8217;clock. It is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>the fourth anniversary of the first bloodshed of the
war at Baltimore. It was said to-day, that while
the services were being held in the White House
and Lincoln&#8217;s body lay in state under the dome
of the capitol, that more than twenty-five millions
of people all over the civilized world were gathered
in their churches weeping over the death of the martyred
President. We met at our church at half
after ten o&#8217;clock this morning. The bells tolled
until eleven o&#8217;clock, when the services commenced.
The church was beautifully decorated with flags
and black and white cloth, wreaths, mottoes and
flowers, the galleries and all. The whole effect
was fine. There was a shield beneath the arch
of the pulpit with this text upon it: &#8220;The memory
of the just is blessed.&#8221; It was beautiful.
Under the choir-loft the picture of Abraham
Lincoln hung amid the flags and drapery. The
motto, beneath the gallery, was this text: &#8220;Know
ye that the Lord He is God.&#8221; The four pastors
of the place walked in together and took seats upon
the platform, which was constructed for the occasion.
The choir chanted &#8220;Lord, Thou hast been
our dwelling-place in all generations,&#8221; and then the
Episcopal rector, Rev. Mr. Leffingwell, read from
the psalter, and Rev. Dr. Daggett followed with
prayer. Judge Taylor was then called upon for
a short address, and he spoke well, as he always
does. The choir sang &#8220;God is our refuge and our
strength.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span><i>Thursday, April</i> 20.&mdash;The papers are full of the
account of the funeral obsequies of President Lincoln.
We take Harper&#8217;s Weekly and every event
is pictured so vividly it seems as though we were eye
witnesses of it all. The picture of &#8220;Lincoln at
home&#8221; is beautiful. What a dear, kind man he
was. It is a comfort to know that the assassination
was not the outcome of an organized plot of
Southern leaders, but rather a conspiracy of a few
fanatics, who undertook in this way to avenge the
defeat of their cause. It is rumored that one of
the conspirators has been located.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>April</i> 24.&mdash;Fannie Gaylord and Kate Lapham
have returned from their eastern trip and told us
of attending the President&#8217;s funeral in Albany, and
I had a letter from Bessie Seymour, who is in New
York, saying that she walked in the procession until
half past two in the morning, in order to see his
face. They say that they never saw him in life, but
in death he looked just as all the pictures represent
him. We all wear Lincoln badges now, with pin
attached. They are pictures of Lincoln upon a tiny
flag, bordered with crape. Susie Daggett has just
made herself a flag, six feet by four. It was a lot
of work. Mrs. Noah T. Clarke gave one to her
husband upon his birthday, April 8. I think everybody
ought to own a flag.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>April</i> 26.&mdash;Now we have the news that J. Wilkes
Booth, who shot the President and who has been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>concealing himself in Virginia, has been caught, and
refusing to surrender was shot dead. It has taken
just twelve days to bring him to retribution. I am
glad that he is dead if he could not be taken alive,
but it seems as though shooting was too good for
him. However, we may as well take this as really
God&#8217;s way, as the death of the President, for if
he had been taken alive, the country would have
been so furious to get at him and tear him to pieces
the turmoil would have been great and desperate.
It may be the best way to dispose of him. Of
course, it is best, or it would not be so. Mr. Morse
called this evening and he thinks Booth was shot by
a lot of cowards. The flags have been flying all
day, since the news came, but all, excepting Albert
Granger, seem sorry that he was not disabled instead
of being shot dead. Albert seems able to look into
the &#8220;beyond&#8221; and also to locate departed spirits.
His &#8220;latest&#8221; is that he is so glad that Booth got
to h&mdash;l before Abraham Lincoln got to Springfield.</p>

<p>Mr. Fred Thompson went down to New York
last Saturday and while stopping a few minutes at
St. Johnsville, he heard a man crowing over the
death of the President. Mr. Thompson marched up
to him, collared him and landed him nicely in the
gutter. The bystanders were delighted and carried
the champion to a platform and called for a speech,
which was given. Quite a little episode. Every
one who hears the story, says: &#8220;Three cheers for
F. F. Thompson.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>The other afternoon at our society Kate Lapham
wanted to divert our minds from gossip I think,
and so started a discussion upon the respective characters
of Washington and Napoleon. It was just
after supper and Laura Chapin was about resuming
her sewing and she exclaimed, &#8220;Speaking of Washington,
makes me think that I ought to wash
my hands,&#8221; so she left the room for that purpose.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>May</i> 7.&mdash;Anna and I wore our new poke bonnets
to church this morning and thought we looked quite
&#8220;scrumptious,&#8221; but Grandmother said after we got
home, if she had realized how unbecoming they
were to us and to the house of the Lord, she could
not have countenanced them enough to have sat in
the same pew. However, she tried to agree with
Dr. Daggett in his text, &#8220;It is good for us to be
here.&#8221; It was the first time in a month that he
had not preached about the affairs of the Nation.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the Sacrament was administered
and Rev. A. D. Eddy, D. D., who was pastor from
1823 to 1835, was present and officiated. Deacon
Castle and Deacon Hayes passed the communion.
Dr. Eddy concluded the services with some personal
memories. He said that forty-two years ago last
November, he presided upon a similar occasion for
the first time in his life and it was in this very
church. He is now the only surviving male member
who was present that day, but there are six
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>women living, and Grandmother is one of the
six.</p>

<p>The Monthly Concert of Prayer for Missions was
held in the chapel in the evening. Dr. Daggett told
us that the collection taken for missions during the
past year amounted to $500. He commended us
and said it was the largest sum raised in one year
for this purpose in the twenty years of his pastorate.
Dr. Eddy then said that in contrast he would tell
us that the collection for missions the first year he
was here, amounted to $5, and that he was advised
to touch very lightly upon the subject in his appeals
as it was not a popular theme with the majority of
the people. One member, he said, annexed three
ciphers to his name when asked to subscribe to a
missionary document which was circulated, and another
man replied thus to an appeal for aid in evangelizing
a portion of Asia: &#8220;If you want to send
a missionary to Jerusalem, Yates county, I will
contribute, but not a cent to go to the other side
of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rev. C. H. A. Buckley was present also and gave
an interesting talk. By way of illustration, he said
he knew a small boy who had been earning twenty-five
cents a week for the heathen by giving up eating
butter. The other day he seemed to think that his
generosity, as well as his self-denial, had reached
the utmost limit and exclaimed as he sat at the table,
&#8220;I think the heathen have had gospel enough, please
pass the butter.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span><i>May</i> 10.&mdash;Jeff Davis was captured to-day at
Irwinsville, Ga., when he was attempting to escape
in woman&#8217;s apparel. Mr. Green drew a picture
of him, and Mr. Finley made photographs
from it. We bought one as a souvenir of the
war.</p>

<p>The big headlines in the papers this morning say,
&#8220;The hunt is up. He brandisheth a bowie-knife
but yieldeth to six solid arguments. At Irwinsville,
Ga., about daylight on the 10th instant, Col. Prichard,
commanding the 4th Michigan Cavalry, captured
Jeff Davis, family and staff. They will be
forwarded under strong guard without delay.&#8221;
The flags have been flying all day, and every one
is about as pleased over the manner of his capture
as over the fact itself. Lieutenant Hathaway, one
of the staff, is a friend of Mr. Manning Wells, and
he was pretty sure he would follow Davis, so we
were not surprised to see his name among the captured.
Mr. Wells says he is as fine a horseman as
he ever saw.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Monday evg., May</i> 22.&mdash;I went to Teachers&#8217;
meeting at Mrs. Worthington&#8217;s to-night. Mrs.
George Willson is the leader and she told us at the
last meeting to be prepared this evening to give our
opinion in regard to the repentance of Solomon before
he died. We concluded that he did repent
although the Bible does not absolutely say so.
Grandmother thinks such questions are unprofitable,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>as we would better be repenting of our sins, instead
of hunting up Solomon&#8217;s at this late day.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>May</i> 23.&mdash;We arise about 5:30 nowadays and
Anna does not like it very well. I asked her why
she was not as good natured as usual to-day and
she said it was because she got up &#8220;s&#8217;urly.&#8221; She
thinks Solomon must have been acquainted with
Grandmother when he wrote &#8220;She ariseth while it
is yet night and giveth meat to her household and
a portion to her maidens.&#8221; Patrick Burns, the
&#8220;poet,&#8221; who has also been our man of all work
the past year, has left us to go into Mr. McKechnie&#8217;s
employ. He seemed to feel great regret when he
bade us farewell and told us he never lived in a better
regulated home than ours and he hoped his successor
would take the same interest in us that he
had. Perhaps he will give us a recommendation!
He left one of his poems as a souvenir. It is entitled,
&#8220;There will soon be an end to the war,&#8221; written
in March, hence a prophecy. He said Mr.
Morse had read it and pronounced it &#8220;tip top.&#8221; It
was mostly written in capitals and I asked him
if he followed any rule in regard to their use.
He said &#8220;Oh, yes, always begin a line with one and
then use your own discretion with the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>May</i> 25.&mdash;I wish that I could have been in Washington
this week, to have witnessed the grand review
of Meade&#8217;s and Sherman&#8217;s armies. The newspaper
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>accounts are most thrilling. The review commenced
on Tuesday morning and lasted two days.
It took over six hours for Meade&#8217;s army to pass the
grand stand, which was erected in front of the
President&#8217;s house. It was witnessed by the President,
Generals Grant, Meade, and Sherman, Secretary
Stanton, and many others in high authority.
At ten o&#8217;clock, Wednesday morning, Sherman&#8217;s
army commenced to pass in review. His men did
not show the signs of hardship and suffering which
marked the appearance of the Army of the Potomac.
The scenes enacted were historic and wonderful.
Flags were flying everywhere and windows,
doorsteps and sidewalks were crowded with
people, eager to get a view of the grand armies.
The city was as full of strangers, who had come
to see the sight, as on Inauguration Day. Very
soon, all that are left of the companies, who went
from here, will be marching home, &#8220;with glad and
gallant tread.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>June</i> 3.&mdash;I was invited up to Sonnenberg yesterday
and Lottie and Abbie Clark called for me at
5:30 <span class='sc'>p.m.</span>, with their pony and democrat wagon.
Jennie Rankine was the only other lady present and,
for a wonder, the party consisted of six gentlemen
and five ladies, which has not often been the case
during the war. After supper we adjourned to the
lawn and played croquet, a new game which Mr.
Thompson just brought from New York. It is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>something like billiards, only a mallet is used instead
of a cue to hit the balls. I did not like it very
well, because I couldn&#8217;t hit the balls through the
wickets as I wanted to. &#8220;We&#8221; sang all the songs,
patriotic and sentimental, that we could think of.</p>

<p>Mr. Lyon came to call upon me to-day, before he
returned to New York. He is a very pleasant
young man. I told him that I regretted that I could
not sing yesterday, when all the others did, and
that the reason that I made no attempts in that line
was due to the fact that one day in church, when
I thought I was singing a very good alto, my grandfather
whispered to me, and said: &#8220;Daughter,
you are off the key,&#8221; and ever since then, I had sung
with the spirit and with the understanding, but not
with my voice. He said perhaps I could get some
one to do my singing for me, some day. I told him
he was very kind to give me so much encouragement.
Anna went to a Y.M.C.A. meeting last evening at
our chapel and said, when the hymn &#8220;Rescue the
perishing,&#8221; was given out, she just &#8220;raised her
Ebenezer&#8221; and sang every verse as hard as she
could. The meeting was called in behalf of a
young man who has been around town for the past
few days, with only one arm, who wants to be a minister
and sells sewing silk and needles and writes
poetry during vacation to help himself along. I have
had a cough lately and Grandmother decided yesterday
to send for the doctor. He placed me in a chair
and thumped my lungs and back and listened to my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>breathing while Grandmother sat near and watched
him in silence, but finally she said, &#8220;Caroline isn&#8217;t
used to being pounded!&#8221; The doctor smiled and
said he would be very careful, but the treatment was
not so severe as it seemed. After he was gone, we
asked Grandmother if she liked him and she said
yes, but if she had known of his &#8220;new-fangled&#8221;
notions and that he wore a full beard she might
not have sent for him! Because Dr. Carr was
clean-shaven and also Grandfather and Dr. Daggett,
and all of the Grangers, she thinks that is the
only proper way. What a funny little lady she is!</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>June</i> 8.&mdash;There have been unusual attractions
down town for the past two days. About 5 <span class='sc'>p.m.</span>
a man belonging to the Ravel troupe walked a rope,
stretched across Main street from the third story
of the Webster House to the chimney of the building
opposite. He is said to be Blondin&#8217;s only rival
and certainly performed some extraordinary feats.
He walked across and then returned backwards.
Then took a wheel-barrow across and returned with
it backwards. He went across blindfolded with a
bag over his head. Then he attached a short
trapeze to the rope and performed all sorts of gymnastics.
There were at least 1,000 people in the
street and in the windows gazing at him. Grandmother
says that she thinks all such performances
are wicked, tempting Providence to win the applause
of men. Nothing would induce her to look upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>such things. She is a born reformer and would
abolish all such schemes. This morning she wanted
us to read the 11th chapter of Hebrews to her, about
faith, and when we had finished the forty verses,
Anna asked her what was the difference between
her and Moses. Grandmother said there were many
points of difference. Anna was not found in the
bulrushes and she was not adopted by a king&#8217;s
daughter. Anna said she was thinking how the
verse read, &#8220;Moses was a proper child,&#8221; and she
could not remember having ever done anything
strictly &#8220;proper&#8221; in her life. I noticed that Grandmother
did not contradict her, but only smiled.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>June</i> 13.&mdash;Van Amburgh&#8217;s circus was in town
to-day and crowds attended and many of our most
highly respected citizens, but Grandmother had
other things for us to consider.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>June</i> 16.&mdash;The census man for this town is Mr.
Jeudevine. He called here to-day and was very inquisitive,
but I think I answered all of his questions
although I could not tell him the exact amount
of my property. Grandmother made us laugh to-day
when we showed her a picture of the Siamese
twins, and I said, &#8220;Grandmother, if I had been
their mother I should have cut them apart when they
were babies, wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221; The dear little lady
looked up so bright and said, &#8220;If I had been Mrs.
Siam, I presume I should have done just as she did.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>I don&#8217;t believe that we will be as amusing as she
is when we are 82 years old.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Saturday, July</i> 8.&mdash;What excitement there must
have been in Washington yesterday over the execution
of the conspirators. It seems terrible that Mrs.
Surratt should have deserved hanging with the
others. I saw a picture of them all upon a scaffold
and her face was screened by an umbrella. I read
in one paper that the doctor who dressed Booth&#8217;s
broken leg was sentenced to the Dry Tortugas.
Jefferson Davis, I suppose, is glad to have nothing
worse served upon him, thus far, than confinement
in Fortress Monroe. It is wonderful that 800,000
men are returning so quietly from the army to civil
life that it is scarcely known, save by the welcome
which they receive in their own homes.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>July</i> 16.&mdash;Rev. Dr. Buddington, of Brooklyn,
preached to-day. His wife was Miss Elizabeth
Willson, Clara Coleman&#8217;s sister. My Sunday
School book is &#8220;Mill on the Floss,&#8221; but Grandmother
says it is not Sabbath reading, so I am
stranded for the present.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>December</i> 8.&mdash;Yesterday was Thanksgiving day.
I do not remember that it was ever observed in
December before. President Johnson appointed it
as a day of national thanksgiving for our many
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>blessings as a people, and Governor Fenton and
several governors of other states have issued proclamations
in accordance with the President&#8217;s recommendation.
The weather was very unpleasant, but
we attended the union thanksgiving service held in
our church. The choir sang America for the opening
piece. Dr. Daggett read Miriam&#8217;s song of
praise: &#8220;The Lord hath triumphed gloriously, the
horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.&#8221;
Then he offered one of his most eloquent and fervent
prayers, in which the returned soldiers, many
of whom are in broken health or maimed for life,
in consequence of their devotion and loyalty to their
country, were tenderly remembered. His text was
from the 126th Psalm, &#8220;The Lord hath done great
things for us, whereof we are glad.&#8221; It was one of
his best sermons. He mentioned three things in
particular which the Lord has done for us,
whereof we are glad: First, that the war has
closed; second, that the Union is preserved; third,
for the abolition of slavery. After the sermon, a
collection was taken for the poor, and Dr. A. D.
Eddy, who was present, offered prayer. The choir
sang an anthem which they had especially prepared
for the occasion, and then all joined in the doxology.
Uncle Thomas Beals&#8217; family of four united with our
three at Thanksgiving dinner. Uncle sent to New
York for the oysters, and a famous big turkey,
with all the usual accompaniments, made us a fine
repast. Anna and Ritie Tyler are reading together
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>Irving&#8217;s Life of Washington, two afternoons each
week. I wonder how long they will keep it up.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>December</i> 11.&mdash;I have been down town buying
material for garments for our Home Missionary
family which we are to make in our society. Anna
and I were cutting them out and basting them ready
for sewing, and grandmother told us to save all the
basting threads when we were through with them
and tie them and wind them on a spool for use another
time. Anna, who says she never wants to begin
anything that she cannot finish in 15 minutes,
felt rather tired at the prospect of this unexpected
task and asked Grandmother how she happened to
contract such economical ideas. Grandmother told
her that if she and Grandfather had been wasteful
in their younger days, we would not have any silk
dresses to wear now. Anna said if that was the
case she was glad that Grandmother saved the basting
thread!</p>

<p><i>February</i> 13.&mdash;Our brother James was married
to-day to Louise Livingston James of New York
City.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>February</i> 20.&mdash;Our society is going to hold a fair
for the Freedmen, in the Town Hall. Susie Daggett
and I have been there all day to see about the
tables and stoves. We got Mrs. Binks to come
and help us.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>February</i> 21.&mdash;Been at the hall all day, trimming
the room. Mr. Thompson and Mr. Backus came
down and if they had not helped us we would not
have done much. Mr. Backus put up all the principal
drapery and made it look beautiful.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>February</i> 22.&mdash;At the hall all day. The fair
opened at 2 <span class='sc'>p.m.</span> We had quite a crowd in the
evening and took in over three hundred dollars.
Charlie Hills and Ellsworth Daggett stayed there
all night to take care of the hall. We had a fish
pond, a grab-bag and a post-office. Anna says they
had all the smart people in the post-office to write
the letters,&mdash;Mr. Morse, Miss Achert, Albert
Granger and herself. Some one asked Albert
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>Granger if his law business was good and he said
one man thronged into his office one day.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>February</i> 23.&mdash;We took in two hundred dollars
to-day at the fair. We wound up with an auction.
We asked Mrs. George Willson if she could not write
a poem expressing our thanks to Mr. Backus and
she stepped aside for about five minutes and handed
us the following lines which we sent to him. We
think it is about the nicest thing in the whole fair.</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<table summary='poetry' class='left2'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;In ancient time the God of Wine</p>

<p>The Backus whom we honor now</p>
<p>Would scorn to wreathe his generous brow</p>
<p>With heathen emblems&mdash;better he</p>
<p>Will love our gratitude to see</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>February</i> 24.&mdash;Susie Daggett and I went to the
hall this morning to clean up. We sent back the
dishes, not one broken, and disposed of everything
but the tables and stoves, which were to be taken
away this afternoon. We feel quite satisfied with
the receipts so far, but the expenses will be considerable.</p>

<p>In <i>Ontario County Times</i> of the following week
we find this card of thanks:</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span><i>February</i> 28.&mdash;The Fair for the benefit of the
Freedmen, held in the Town Hall on Thursday and
Friday of last week was eminently successful, and
the young ladies take this method of returning their
sincere thanks to the people of Canandaigua and
vicinity for their generous contributions and liberal
patronage. It being the first public enterprise in
which the Society has ventured independently, the
young ladies were somewhat fearful of the result,
but having met with such generous responses from
every quarter they feel assured that they need never
again doubt of success in any similar attempt so
long as Canandaigua contains so many large hearts
and corresponding purses. But our village cannot
have all the praise this time. The Society is particularly
indebted to Mr. F. F. Thompson and Mr.
S. D. Backus of New York City, for their very substantial
aid, not only in gifts and unstinted patronage,
but for their invaluable labor in the decoration
of the hall and conduct of the Fair. But for them
most of the manual labor would have fallen upon
the ladies. The thanks of the Society are especially
due, also, to those ladies who assisted personally
with their superior knowledge and older
experience. Also to Mr. W. P. Fiske for his valuable
services as cashier, and to Messrs. Daggett,
Chapin and Hills for services at the door; and to all
the little boys and girls who helped in so many ways.</p>

<p>The receipts amounted to about $490, and thanks
to our cashier, the money is all good, and will soon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>be on its way carrying substantial visions of something
to eat and to wear to at least a few of the poor
Freedmen of the South.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Mr. Editor</span>&mdash;I expected to see an account of the
Young Ladies&#8217; Fair in your last number, but only
saw a very handsome acknowledgment by the ladies
to the citizens. Your &#8220;local&#8221; must have been absent;
and I beg the privilege in behalf of myself and many
others of doing tardy justice to the successful efforts
of the Aid Society at their debut February 22nd.</p>

<p>Gotham furnished an artist and an architect, and
the Society did the rest. The decorations were in
excellent taste, and so were the young ladies. The
eatables were very toothsome. The skating pond was
never in better condition. On entering the hall I
paused first before the table of toys, fancy work and
perfumery. Here was the President, and I hope I
shall be pardoned for saying that no President since
the days of Washington can compare with the President
of this Society. Then I visited a candy table,
and hesitated a long time before deciding which I
would rather eat, the delicacies that were sold, or the
charming creatures who sold them. One delicious
morsel, in a pink silk, was so tempting that I seriously
contemplated eating her with a spoon&mdash;waterfall and
all. [By the way, how do we know that the Romans
wore waterfalls? Because Marc Antony, in his
funeral oration on Mr. C&aelig;sar, exclaimed, &#8220;O water
fall was there, my countrymen!&#8221;] At this point my
attention was attracted by a fish pond. I tried my luck,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>caught a whale, and seeing all my friends beginning
to blubber, I determined to visit the old woman who
lived in a shoe.&mdash;She was very glad to see me. I
bought one of her children, which the Society can
redeem for $1,000 in smoking caps.</p>

<p>The fried oysters were delicious; a great many
of the bivalves got into a stew, and I helped several
of them out. Delicate ice cream, nicely &#8220;baked in
cowld ovens,&#8221; was destroyed in immense quantities.
I scream when I remember the plates full I devoured,
and the number of bright women to whom I paid my
devours. Beautiful cigar girls sold fragrant Havanas,
and bit off the ends at five cents apiece, extra. The
fair post-mistress and her fair clerks, so fair that they
were almost fairies, drove a very thriving business.</p>

<p>It was altogether a &#8220;great moral show.&#8221;&mdash;Let no
man say hereafter that the young ladies of Canandaigua
are uneducated in all that makes women lovely
and useful. Anna Dickinson has no mission to this
town. The members of this Society have won the admiration
of all their friends, and especially of the most
devoted of their servants,</p>

<p>If I had written that article, I should have given
the praise to Susie Daggett, for it belongs to her.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday, June</i> 24.&mdash;My Sunday School scholars
are learning the shorter catechism. One recited
thirty-five answers to questions to-day, another
twenty-six, another twenty, the others eleven.
Very well indeed. They do not see why it is called
the &#8220;shorter&#8221; Catechism! They all had their ambrotypes
taken with me yesterday at Finley&#8217;s&mdash;Mary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>Hoyt, Fannie and Ella Lyon, Ella Wood, Ella Van
Tyne, Mary Vanderbrook, Jennie Whitlaw and
Katie Neu. They are all going to dress in white
and sit on the front seat in church at my wedding.
Grandmother had Mrs. Gooding make individual
fruit cakes for each of them and also some for each
member of our sewing society.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Thursday, June</i> 21.&mdash;We went to a lawn fete at
Mrs. F. F. Thompson&#8217;s this afternoon. It was a
beautiful sight. The flowers, the grounds, the
young people and the music all combined to make
the occasion perfect.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Note:</i> Canandaigua is the summer home of Mrs.
Thompson, who has previously given the village a
children&#8217;s playground, a swimming school, a hospital
and a home for the aged, and this year (1911) has presented
a park as a beauty spot at foot of Canandaigua
Lake.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>June</i> 28.&mdash;Dear Abbie Clark and Captain Williams
were married in the Congregational church
this evening. The church was trimmed beautifully
and Abbie looked sweet. We attended the reception
afterwards at her house. &#8220;May calm and sunshine
hallow their clasped hands.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>July</i> 15.&mdash;The girls of the Society have sent me
my flag bed quilt, which they have just finished. It
was hard work quilting such hot days but it is done
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>beautifully. Bessie Seymour wrote the names on
the stars. In the center they used six stars for
&#8220;Three rousing cheers for the Union.&#8221; The names
on the others are Sarah McCabe, Mary Paul, Fannie
Paul, Fannie Palmer, Nettie Palmer, Susie Daggett,
Fannie Pierce, Sarah Andrews, Lottie Clark, Abbie

busy to get Abbie Clark&#8217;s quilt and mine finished
within one month. They hope that the rest of the
girls will postpone their nuptials till there is a
change in the weather. Mercury stands 90 degrees
in the shade.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 27.&mdash;Col. James M. Bull was buried from
the home of Mr. Alexander Howell to-day, as none
of his family reside here now.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>November</i> 13.&mdash;Our brother John and wife and
baby Pearl have gone to London, England, to live.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>December</i> 28.&mdash;A large party of Canandaiguans
went over to Rochester last evening to hear Charles
Dickens&#8217; lecture, and enjoyed it more than I can
possibly express. He was quite hoarse and had
small bills distributed through the Opera House
with the announcement:</p>

<p style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>MR. CHARLES DICKENS</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Begs indulgence for a Severe Cold, but hopes its
effects may not be very perceptible after a few minutes&#8217;
Reading.</p>

<p>Friday, December 27th, 1867.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We brought these notices home with us for souvenirs.
He looks exactly like his pictures. It was
worth a great deal just to look upon the man who
wrote Little Dorrit, David Copperfield and all the
other books, which have delighted us so much. We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>hope that he will live to write a great many more.
He spoke very appreciatively of his enthusiastic reception
in this country and almost apologized for
some of the opinions that he had expressed in his
&#8220;American Notes,&#8221; which he published, after his
first visit here, twenty-five years ago. He evidently
thinks that the United States of America are quite
worth while.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 6.&mdash;Under the auspices of the Y.M.C.A.,
Hon. George H. Stuart, President of the U. S.
Christian Commission, spoke in an open air meeting
on the square this afternoon and in our
church this evening. The house was packed and
such eloquence I never heard from mortal lips. He
ought to be called the Whitefield of America. He
told of the good the Christian Commission had done
before the war and since. Such war stories I never
heard. They took up a collection which must have
amounted to hundreds of dollars.</p>

<p><i>Naples, June.</i>&mdash;John has invited Aunt Ann Field,
and James, his wife and me and Babe Abigail to
come to England to make them a visit, and we
expect to sail on the Baltic July sixth.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>On board S.S. Baltic, July</i> 7.&mdash;We left New
York yesterday under favorable circumstances. It
was a beautiful summer day, flags were flying and
everything seemed so joyful we almost forgot we
were leaving home and native land. There were
many passengers, among them being Mr. and Mrs.
Anthony Drexel and U. S. Grant, Jr., who boarded
the steamer from a tug boat which came down the
bay alongside when we had been out half an hour.
President Grant was with him and stood on deck,
smoking the proverbial cigar. We were glad to
see him and the passengers gave him three cheers
and three times three, with the greatest enthusiasm.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Liverpool, July</i> 16.&mdash;We arrived here to-day,
having been just ten days on the voyage. There
were many clergymen of note on board, among
them, Rev. John H. Vincent, D.D., eminent in the
Methodist Episcopal Church, who is preparing International
Sunday School lessons. He sat at our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>table and Philip Phillips also, who is a noted evangelistic
singer. They held services both Sabbaths,
July 7 and 15, in the grand saloon of the steamer,
and also in the steerage where the text was &#8220;And
they willingly received him into the ship.&#8221; The
immigrants listened eagerly, when the minister
urged them all to &#8220;receive Jesus.&#8221; We enjoyed
several evening literary entertainments, when it was
too cold or windy to sit on deck.</p>

<p>We had the most luscious strawberries at dinner
to-night, that I ever ate. So large and red and ripe,
with the hulls on and we dipped them in powdered
sugar as we ate them, a most appetizing way.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>London, July</i> 17.&mdash;On our way to London to-day
I noticed beautiful flower beds at every station, making
our journey almost a path of roses. In the
fields, men and women both, were harvesting the
hay, making picturesque scenes, for the sky was
cloudless and I was reminded of the old hymn,
commencing</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<table summary='poetry' class='left2'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,</p>
<p>Stand dressed in living green.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
</div>

<p>We performed the journey from Liverpool to
London, a distance of 240 miles, in five hours.
John, Laura and little Pearl met us at Euston Station,
and we were soon whirled away in cabs to
24 Upper Woburn Place, Tavistock Square, John&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>residence. Dinner was soon ready, a most bountiful
repast. We spent the remainder of the day
visiting and enjoying ourselves generally. It
seemed so good to be at the end of the journey,
although we had only two days of really unpleasant
weather on the voyage. John and Laura are so
kind and hospitable. They have a beautiful home,
lovely children and apparently every comfort and
luxury which this world can afford.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday, July</i> 22.&mdash;We went to Spurgeon&#8217;s Tabernacle
this morning to listen to this great preacher,
with thousands of others. I had never looked upon
such a sea of faces before, as I beheld from the gallery
where we sat. The pulpit was underneath one
gallery, so there seemed as many people over the
preacher&#8217;s head, as there were beneath and around
him and the singing was as impressive as the sermon.
I thought of the hymn, &#8220;Hark ten thousand
harps and voices, Sound the notes of praise above.&#8221;
Mr. Spurgeon was so lame from rheumatism that
he used two canes and placed one knee on a chair
beside him, when preaching. His text was &#8220;And
there shall be a new heaven and a new earth.&#8221; I
found that all I had heard of his eloquence was true.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday, July</i> 29.&mdash;We have spent the entire week
sightseeing, taking in Hyde Park, Windsor Castle,
Westminster Abbey, St. Paul&#8217;s Cathedral, the
Tower of London and British Museum. We also
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>went to Madame Tussaud&#8217;s exhibition of wax figures
and while I was looking in the catalogue for
the number of an old gentleman who was sitting
down apparently asleep, he got up and walked away!
We drove to Sydenham ten miles from London, to
see the Crystal Palace which Abbie called the
&#8220;Christmas Palace.&#8221; Mr. Alexander Howell and
Mr. Henry Chesebro of Canandaigua are here and
came to see us to-day.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>August</i> 13.&mdash;Amid the whirl of visiting, shopping
and sightseeing in this great city, my diary has been
well nigh forgotten. The descriptive letters to
home friends have been numerous and knowing that
they would be preserved, I thought perhaps they
would do as well for future reference as a diary
kept for the same purpose, but to-day, as St.
Pancras&#8217; bell was tolling and a funeral procession
going by, we heard by cable of the death of our
dear, dear Grandmother, the one who first encouraged
us to keep a journal of daily deeds, and who
was always most interested in all that interested us
and now I cannot refrain if I would, from writing
down at this sad hour, of all the grief that is in my
heart. I sorrow not for her. She has only stepped
inside the temple-gate where she has long been waiting
for the Lord&#8217;s entrance call. I weep for ourselves
that we shall see her dear face no more. It
does not seem possible that we shall never see her
again on this earth. She took such an interest in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>our journey and just as we started I put my dear
little Abigail Beals Clarke in her lap to receive her
parting blessing. As we left the house she sat at
the front window and saw us go and smiled her
farewell.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>August</i> 20.&mdash;Anna has written how often Grandmother
prayed that &#8220;He who holds the winds in his
fists and the waters in the hollow of his hands,
would care for us and bring us to our desired
haven.&#8221; She had received one letter, telling of our
safe arrival and how much we enjoyed going about
London, when she was suddenly taken ill and Dr.
Hayes said she could never recover. Anna&#8217;s letter
came, after ten days, telling us all the sad news, and
how Grandmother looked out of the window the
last night before she was taken ill, and up at the
moon and stars and said how beautiful they were.
Anna says, &#8220;How can I ever write it? Our dear
little Grandmother died on my bed to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>August</i> 30.&mdash;John, Laura and their nurse and
baby John, Aunt Ann Field and I started Tuesday
on a trip to Scotland, going first to Glasgow where
we remained twenty-four hours. We visited the
Cathedral and were about to go down into the crypt
when the guide told us that Gen. Sherman of U.S.A.
was just coming in. We stopped to look at him
and felt like telling him that we too were Americans.
He was in good health and spirits, apparently, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>looked every inch a soldier with his cloak a-la-militaire
around him. We visited the Lochs and spent
one night at Inversnaid on Loch Lomond and then
went on up Loch Katrine to the Trossachs. When
we took the little steamer, John said, &#8220;All aboard
for Naples,&#8221; it reminded him so much of Canandaigua
Lake. We arrived safely in Edinburgh the
next day by rail and spent four days in that charming
city, so beautiful in situation and in every
natural advantage. We saw the window from
whence John Knox addressed the populace and we
also visited the Castle on the hill. Then we went
to Melrose and visited the Abbey and also Abbotsford,
the residence of Sir Walter Scott. We went
through the rooms and saw many curios and paintings
and also the library. Sir Walter&#8217;s chair at
his desk was protected by a rope, but Laura, nothing
daunted, lifted the baby over it and seated him there
for a moment saying &#8220;I am sure, now, he will be
clever.&#8221; We continued our journey that night and
arrived in London the next morning.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Ventnor, Isle of Wight, September</i> 9.&mdash;Aunt
Ann, Laura&#8217;s sister, Florentine Arnold, nurse and
two children, Pearl and Abbie, and I are here for
three weeks on the seashore.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>September</i> 16.&mdash;We have visited all the neighboring
towns, the graves of the Dairyman&#8217;s daughter
and little Jane, the young cottager, and the scene
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>of Leigh Richmond&#8217;s life and labors. We have enjoyed
bathing in the surf, and the children playing
in the sands and riding on the donkeys.</p>

<p>We have very pleasant rooms, in a house kept by
an old couple, Mr. and Mrs. Tuddenham, down on
the esplanade. They serve excellent meals in a most
homelike way. We have an abundance of delicious
milk and cream which they tell me comes from
&#8220;Cowes&#8221;!</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>London, September</i> 30.&mdash;Anna has come to England
to live with John for the present. She came
on the Adriatic, arriving September 24. We are so
glad to see her once more and will do all in our
power to cheer her in her loneliness.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Paris, October</i> 18.&mdash;John, Laura, Aunt Ann and
I, nurse and baby, arrived here to-day for a few
days&#8217; visit. We had rather a stormy passage on
the Channel. I asked one of the seamen the name
of the vessel and he answered me &#8220;The H&#8217;Albert
H&#8217;Edward, Miss!&#8221; This information must have
given me courage, for I was perfectly sustained till
we reached Calais, although nearly every one around
me succumbed.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>October</i> 22.&mdash;We have driven through the Bois
de Boulogne, visited Père la Chaise, the Morgue, the
ruins of the Tuileries, which are left just as they
were since the Commune. We spent half a day at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>the Louvre without seeing half of its wonders. I
went alone to a photographer&#8217;s, Le Jeune, to be
&#8220;taken&#8221; and had a funny time. He queried
&#8220;Parlez-vous Français?&#8221; I shook my head and
asked him &#8220;Parlez-vous Anglaise?&#8221; at which
query he shrugged his shoulders and shook his head!
I ventured to tell him by signs that I would like my
picture taken and he held up two sizes of pictures
and asked me &#8220;Le cabinet, le vignette?&#8221; I held
up my fingers, to tell him I would like six of each,
whereupon he proceeded to make ready and when
he had seated me, he made me understand that he
hoped I would sit perfectly still, which I endeavored
to do. After the first sitting, he showed displeasure
and let me know that I had swayed to and fro. Another
attempt was more satisfactory and he said
&#8220;Très bien, Madame,&#8221; and I gave him my address
and departed.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>October</i> 26.&mdash;My photographs have come and all
pronounce them indeed &#8220;très bien.&#8221; We visited the
Tomb of Napoleon to-day.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>October</i> 27.&mdash;We attended service to-day at the
American Chapel and I enjoyed it more than I
can ever express. After hearing a foreign tongue
for the past ten days, it seemed like getting home to
go into a Presbyterian church and hear a sermon
from an American pastor. The singing in the
choir was so homelike, that when they sang &#8220;Awake
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>my soul to joyful lays and sing thy great Redeemer&#8217;s
praise,&#8221; it seemed to me that I heard a well
known tenor voice from across the sea, especially
in the refrain &#8220;His loving kindness, oh how free.&#8221;
The text was &#8220;As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth
over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings,
taketh them, beareth them on her wings, so the
Lord did lead him and there was no strange God
with him.&#8221; Deut. 32: 11. It was a wonderful
sermon and I shall never forget it. On our way
home, we noticed the usual traffic going on, building
of houses, women were standing in their doors
knitting and there seemed to be no sign of Sunday
keeping, outside of the church.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>London, October</i> 31.&mdash;John and I returned together
from Paris and now I have only a few days
left before sailing for home. There was an Englishman
here to-day who was bragging about the
beer in England being so much better than could be
made anywhere else. He said, &#8220;In America, you
have the &#8217;ops, I know, but you haven&#8217;t the Thames
water, you know.&#8221; I suppose that would make a
vast difference!</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Sunday, November</i> 3.&mdash;We went to hear Rev. Dr.
Joseph Parker preach at Exeter Hall. He is a new
light, comparatively, and bids fair to rival Spurgeon
and Newman Hall and all the rest. He is
like a lion and again like a lamb in the pulpit.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span><i>Liverpool, November</i> 6.&mdash;I came down to Liverpool
to-day with Abbie and nurse, to sail on the
Baltic, to-morrow. There were two Englishmen
in our compartment and hearing Abbie sing &#8220;I have
a Father in the Promised Land,&#8221; they asked her
where her Father lived and she said &#8220;In America,&#8221;
and told them she was going on the big ship to-morrow
to see him. Then they turned to me and
said they supposed I would be glad to know that the
latest cable from America was that U. S. Grant
was elected for his second term as President of the
United States. I assured them that I was very glad
to hear such good news.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>November</i> 9.&mdash;I did not know any of the passengers
when we sailed, but soon made pleasant acquaintances.
Near me at table are Mr. and Mrs.
Sykes from New York and in course of conversation
I found that she as well as myself, was born
in Penn Yan, Yates County, New York, and that
her parents were members of my Father&#8217;s church,
which goes to prove that the world is not so very
wide after all. Abbie is a great pet among the passengers
and is being passed around from one to
another from morning till night. They love to
hear her sing and coax her to say &#8220;Grace&#8221; at table.
She closes her eyes and folds her hands devoutly
and says, &#8220;For what we are about to receive, may
the Lord make us truly thankful.&#8221; They all
say &#8220;Amen&#8221; to this, for they are fearful that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>they will not perhaps be &#8220;thankful&#8221; when they
finish!</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>November</i> 15.&mdash;I have been on deck every day
but one, and not missed a single meal. There was a
terrible storm one night and the next morning I told
one of the numerous clergymen, that I took great
comfort in the night, thinking that nothing could
happen with so many of the Lord&#8217;s anointed, on
board. He said that he wished he had thought of
that, for he was frightened almost to death! We
have sighted eleven steamers and on Wednesday we
were in sight of the banks of Newfoundland all the
afternoon, our course being unusually northerly and
we encountered no fogs, contrary to the expectation
of all. Every one pronounces the voyage pleasant
and speedy for this time of year.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>Naples, N. Y., November</i> 20.&mdash;We arrived safely
in New York on Sunday. Abbie spied her father
very quickly upon the dock as we slowly came up
and with glad and happy hearts we returned his
&#8220;Welcome home.&#8221; We spent two days in New
York and arrived home safe and sound this
evening.</p>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'><i>November</i> 21.&mdash;My thirtieth birthday, which we,
a reunited family, are spending happily together
around our own fireside, pleasant memories of the
past months adding to the joy of the hour.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>From the <i>New York Evangelist</i> of August 15,
1872, by Rev. Samuel Pratt, D.D.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Died, at Canandaigua, N. Y., August 8, 1872,
Mrs. Abigail Field Beals, widow of Thomas Beals,
in the 98th year of her age. Mrs. Beals, whose
maiden name was Field, was born in Madison,
Conn., April 7, 1784. She was a sister of Rev.
David Dudley Field, D.D., of Stockbridge, Mass.,
and of Rev. Timothy Field, first pastor of the Congregational
church of Canandaigua. She came to
Canandaigua with her brother, Timothy, in 1800.
In 1805 she was married to Thomas Beals, Esq.,
with whom she lived nearly sixty years, until he
fell asleep. They had eleven children, of whom
only four survive. In 1807 she and her husband
united with the Congregational church, of which
they were ever liberal and faithful supporters. Mrs.
Beals loved the good old ways and kept her house
in the simple and substantial style of the past. She
herself belonged to an age of which she was the
last. With great dignity and courtesy of manner
which repelled too much familiarity, she combined
a sweet and winning grace, which attracted all to
her, so that the youth, while they would almost
involuntarily &#8216;rise up before her,&#8217; yet loved to be in
her presence and called her blessed. She possessed
in a rare degree the ornament of a meek and quiet
spirit and lived in an atmosphere of love and peace.
Her home and room were to her children and her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>children&#8217;s children what Jerusalem was to the saints
of old. There they loved to resort and the saddest
thing in her death is the sundering of that tie which
bound so many generations together. She never
ceased to take a deep interest in the prosperity of
the beautiful village of which she and her husband
were the pioneers and for which they did so much
and in the church of which she was the oldest member.
Her mind retained its activity to the last and
her heart was warm in sympathy with every good
work. While she was well informed in all current
events, she most delighted in whatever concerned
the Kingdom. Her Bible and religious books were
her constant companions and her conversation told
much of her better thoughts, which were in Heaven.
Living so that those who knew her never saw in
her anything but fitness for Heaven, she patiently
awaited the Master&#8217;s call and went down to her
grave in a full age like a shock of corn fully ripe that
cometh in its season.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p style='margin-top:1.4em;'>I don&#8217;t think I shall keep a diary any more, only
occasionally jot down things of importance. Mr.
Noah T. Clarke&#8217;s brother got possession of my little
diary in some way one day and when he returned it
I found written on the fly-leaf this inscription to
the diary:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<table summary='poetry' class='left2'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d scarce expect a volume of my size</p>
<p>To hold so much that&#8217;s beautiful and wise,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>And though the heartless world might call me cheap</p>
<p>Yet from my pages some much joy shall reap.</p>
<p>As monstrous oaks from little acorns grow,</p>
<p>And kindly shelter all who toil below,</p>
<p>So my future greatness and the good I do</p>
<p>Shall bless, if not the world, at least a few.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
</div>

<p>I think I will close my old journal with the mottoes
which I find upon an old well-worn writing
book which Anna used for jotting down her youthful
deeds. On the cover I find inscribed, &#8220;Try to
be somebody,&#8221; and on the back of the same book, as
if trying to console herself for unexpected achievement
which she could not prevent, &#8220;Some must be
great!&#8221;</p>

<p><i>June</i> 17.&mdash;Our dear Anna was married to-day to
Mr. Alonzo A. Cummings of Oakland, Cal., and has

<p style='text-align:center;font-weight:bold;margin-top:1em;font-size:1.2em;'>THE HOME BOOK OF VERSE</p>

<p style='text-align:center;'><i>American and English</i> (1580-1912)</p>

<p style='margin-left:1em; text-indent:-1em;'>Compiled by Burton E. Stevenson. Collects the best short
poetry of the English language&mdash;not only the poetry everybody
says is good, but also the verses that everybody
reads. (3742 pages; India paper, 1 vol., 8vo, complete author,
title and first line indices, $7.50 net; carriage 40 cents
extra.)</p>

<p>The most comprehensive and representative collection of
American and English poetry ever published, including
3,120 unabridged poems from some 1,100 authors.</p>

<p>It brings together in one volume the best short poetry
of the English language from the time of Spencer, with
especial attention to American verse.</p>

<p>The copyright deadline has been passed, and some three
hundred recent authors are included, very few of whom
appear in any other general anthology, such as Lionel
Johnson, Noyes, Housman, Mrs. Meynell, Yeats, Dobson,
Lang, Watson, Wilde, Francis Thompson, Gilder, Le
Gallienne, Van Dyke, Woodberry, Riley, etc., etc.</p>

<p>The poems are arranged by subject, and the classification
is unusually close and searching. Some of the most
comprehensive sections are: Children&#8217;s rhymes (300
pages); love poems (800 pages); nature poetry (400
pages); humorous verse (500 pages); patriotic and historical
poems (600 pages); reflective and descriptive poetry
(400 pages). No other collection contains so many popular
favorites and fugitive verses.</p>
